# Introduction of Aivest
[Aivest](https://www.aivestdao.com) is the First Decentralized Fair Launch App for AI Investment Models. For developers, feel free to hop on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/spuZSTUGbc) and reach out!

* **Pre-trained AI Investment Models** - Information AI and investment advisory AI are live at aivestdao.com, a simple frontend for visualization and code for training both regressors and classifiers. A contract implementing a mean-variance optimization and neural network for predicting best portfolio on chain. Feel free to fair launch your own tokenomic of AI investment models!

* **AlphaAI Model** - Aivest utilizes AI to comprehensively track users' investment behaviors, including acquiring new knowledge, secondary trading, market sentiment analysis, airdrops, etc. Ultimately, it forms a digital profile within the crypto industry for each user.

* **ZKML** - To protect your data and customized model, ZKML enables the validation of private data using public models or verifying private models with public data.

* **Fair Launch Contract of AI Model** - An EVM-compatible contract that allows AI prompt triggers for the token launch function of a specific AI model. Token distribution is conducted fairly, without pre-allocating this particular token to a selected group of users.




# AI investment advisory, DEMO:

* According to the transaction history on the blockchain and the fluctuation of past market prices associated with a wallet address, along with factors such as time weighting (where transactions closer to the present carry more weight), frequency of transactions, range of traded currencies, and changes in transaction amounts, an analysis of a user's investment style is conducted.

* Based on this analysis, a suitable portfolio combination is recommended to the user, along with quantifiable data such as monthly return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and other metrics.

* Finally, for a more intuitive understanding of the historical performance of this portfolio combination, a line graph comparing its volatility with the index of the cryptocurrency market for the same period is provided.

# Aspect:

**"Aspect" here refers to helping different users customize various profit and loss risk conditions.**

For example: User A accepts a profit and loss range of "-10%, 20%" for this portfolio, and after a day, User A adjusts the range to "-20%, 20%"; or User B further customizes acceptance of the profit and loss range for this portfolio as "-50%, 50%".

Why Artelaï¼Ÿ

* Firstly, we apply Aspect form Artela to prove the extensibility of our Dapp to support various AI investment models launched on-chain in the future. This ensures concurrency without experiencing adverse resource preemption during high user concurrency, which could lead to a non-smooth user experience and significant increases in transaction fees.

* Users ranging from beginner to expert developers can design and issue their own Tokenomics on the Artela chain through Aivest.

* In the subsequent development of Aivest, as a Decentralized launch app, we definitely need to rely on foundational infrastructures like Artela Aspect. It can provide elastic block space design and independent block spaces for large-scale, ensuring our platform achieves rapid development through User-generated content (UGC).

**The Analytics Aspect brings several valuable features to the Artela Ecosystem:**

* Informed Decision-Making: The DApp (Which using this project) empowers users and developers to make informed decisions based on detailed analytics. This ensures that actions and strategies are guided by real-time and historical data.

* Optimized User Experience: The analytics DApp allows for the optimization of the user experience. Developers can tailor interfaces and features to align with user preferences and needs.

* Smart Contract Performance: This insight enables developers to identify areas for improvement, enhance contract efficiency, and ensure the overall robustness of the ecosystem's smart contract infrastructure.

* Community Engagement: This information can be shared with the community, fostering transparency and trust. Open communication about the ecosystem's performance builds a stronger community and encourages active participation.

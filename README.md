# Introduction of Aivest
[Aivest](https://www.aivestdao.com) is the First Decentralized Fair Launch App for AI Investment Models. For developers, feel free to hop on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/spuZSTUGbc) and reach out!

* **Pre-trained AI Investment Models** - Information AI and investment advisory AI are live at aivestdao.com, a simple frontend for visualization and code for training both regressors and classifiers. A contract implementing a mean-variance optimization and neural network for predicting best portfolio on chain. Feel free to fair launch your own tokenomic of AI investment models!

* **AlphaAI Model** - Aivest utilizes AI to comprehensively track users' investment behaviors, including acquiring new knowledge, secondary trading, market sentiment analysis, airdrops, etc. Ultimately, it forms a digital profile within the crypto industry for each user.

* **ZKML** - To protect your data and customized model, ZKML enables the validation of private data using public models or verifying private models with public data.

* **Fair Launch Contract of AI Model** - An EVM-compatible contract that allows AI prompt triggers for the token launch function of a specific AI model. Token distribution is conducted fairly, without pre-allocating this particular token to a selected group of users.


# Tools and  Papers

* [GPT model](https://openai.com) -  Generative Pre-trained Transformers, commonly known as GPT, are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture and is a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT.

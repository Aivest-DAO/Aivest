How Untraceable is XMR? ,Analysis,"<p>In blockchain design, anonymity and pseudonymity are analogous principles. The Bitcoin network is a pseudonymous blockchain, meaning the transactions are recorded in an open ledger that anyone can view, but personal information about the sender and receiver is not readily transparent. However, advancements in blockchain analysis have led to Bitcoin transactions being easily traceable, with blockchain analytics companies being able to figure out which addresses belong to which people, making Bitcoin Pseudonymous, but not anonymous.</p><p>A couple of prominent techniques involve revealing the real identities of Bitcoin users by connecting the dots between publicly available transaction metadata such as addresses, timestamps and amounts with the user’s IP address. Even when they use separate addresses for every transaction, one can backtrack the transfers to their root with metadata.</p><div class=""raw-html-embed""><style>\n.code-block-important {\n    background: var(--binance-card-background-color);\n}\n.code-block-important blockquote {\n    margin-left: 0;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    padding-left: 30px;\n    line-height: 1.75rem;\n    margin-block-end: 2em;\n    letter-spacing: 0.04em;\n    word-break: break-word;\n    margin-block-start: 0em;\n    border-left: 3px solid orange;\n}\n.code-block-important-description-div{\n    font-weignt:800px;\n    padding: 8px 8px 8px 0px;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=""code-block-important"">\n    <blockquote>\n        <div class=""code-block-important-description-div""><b>Important: </b>IP address tracing is the process of identifying the origin and location of an internet user by analyzing their unique IP address.

If you are curious about the nuances between Monero and Bitcoin, we explore those granular differences in an article&nbsp;in our <a href=""/analysis/monero-vs-bitcoin/"">Bitcoin vs Monero</a>. I suggest checking out Coin Bureau’s&nbsp;learner on the <a href=""/education/what-is-monero/"">Monero Protocol</a> to refresh your concepts. However, here’s a <strong>TLDR of Monero:</strong></p><h2>What is Monero?</h2><p>Monero is the first privacy-focused and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-censorship-resistance"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">censorship-resistant</a> blockchain. Every Monero blockchain user and their transactions are anonymous by default. Two essential characteristics are the cornerstone of the Monero Protocol:</p><ul><li><strong>Untraceability&nbsp;</strong>- All possible senders are equiprobable for each incoming transaction.</li><li><strong>Unlinkability&nbsp;</strong>- It is impossible to prove any two transactions were sent to the same person.</li></ul><p>Despite such anonymity, anyone can cryptographically verify the correct execution of a transaction on the Monero blockchain with transaction proofs recorded in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://localmonero.co/blocks/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">public database</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Monero_Transactions_are_Private_4fcf988698.jpg"" alt=""Monero Transactions are Private.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Monero_Transactions_are_Private_4fcf988698.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Monero_Transactions_are_Private_4fcf988698.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Monero_Transactions_are_Private_4fcf988698.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Monero_Transactions_are_Private_4fcf988698.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>A Monero Explorer transaction snapshot. The blockchain hides sensitive details.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Key features of the Monero blockchain include:</strong></p><h3>Privacy</h3><p>Monero is the strongest proponent of privacy. The network anonymizes transaction amounts and obfuscates sender and receiver identities with cryptographic techniques like <a href=""https://serhack.me/articles/what-is-stealth-address-technology-monero/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">stealth addresses</a> and <a href=""https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringsignatures.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ring signatures</a>.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Monero is a permissionless and decentralized&nbsp;<a href=""/analysis/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/"">Proof-of-Work</a> protocol. Therefore, it benefits from the security properties of similar networks, like no central authority and no control over transaction data or user’s personal information.</p><h3>Equitable Mining</h3><p>Monero uses a unique POW mining algorithm called&nbsp;<strong>RandomX&nbsp;</strong>that is ASIC-resistant. Here is what it means -&nbsp;</p><p>The Bitcoin network follows a “one CPU - one vote” policy in its mining protocol. This logic proved sufficiently equitable in the early days of the network when the hashing power required to run the network was shallow and affordable. However, as the network grew in adoption, specialized hardware called <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ASIC"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ASICs</a> emerged. ASICs are custom-built for mining and solving hash functions efficiently. Bitcoin mining has since become a race to acquire the most potent ASICs, where every CPU is undoubtedly not equitable, leading to the centralization of mining activity in pools and places with cheap electricity.</p><h4>Monero ASIC-Resistant Mining</h4><p>The RandomX mining algorithm constantly updates its code to maintain ASIC resistance. RandomX deploys RAM-heavy techniques to make mining memory intensive. Adding RAM to ASICs is expensive and complex. The memory-hard nature of RandomX outweighs the benefits of deploying expensive ASICs over conventional CPUs, democratizing its consensus process.</p><h3>Adaptive Block Size</h3><p>Monero’s adaptive block size adjusts based on transaction volume, ensuring that mining remains efficient and the network can scale with demand. This feature ensures that transactions are processed on time, even during high demand, benefiting all network participants.</p><h3>IP Address Privacy (Under Development)</h3><p><a href=""https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/kovri.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kovri</a> is a decentralized anonymity technology designed to help hide the IP addresses of participants of the Monero blockchain. IP addresses can reveal the user’s location and real-world identity. Therefore, Kovri enhances the privacy of Monero. Kovri hides IP by encrypting user internet traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>Another subtle design aspect of Monero is its 2-minute transaction confirmation time, which takes about ten minutes to achieve finality. The Monero development team frequently forks the network to add new privacy features. Let’s discuss how Monero works:</p><h2>How Monero Works</h2><p>Monero is a peer-to-peer digital cash network with use cases adjacent to Bitcoin with enhanced privacy techniques. Monero tracks XMR exchanges like Bitcoin as Unspent Transaction Outputs (<a href=""/blockchain/unspent-transaction-output-utxo/"">UTXOs</a>). However, the process of sending and receiving UTXOs is designed to preserve the anonymity of the involved parties. There are three major components at work to achieve this:</p><h3>Ring Signatures: Anonymizing Senders</h3><p>A traditional transaction involves the sender signing the transaction with their private key. Ring signature is an upgraded digital signature on Monero where the actual signature mixes with a bunch of decoy signatures for obfuscation. The decoys are picked from past signed outputs on Monero. The idea behind the setup is that since the actual signer is indistinguishable from the decoys, all pose an equiprobable chance of being real, so no one can know which one is real with absolute certainty.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/How_Monero_hides_sender_s_identity_1201d0074f.jpg"" alt=""How Monero is anonymous"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_How_Monero_hides_sender_s_identity_1201d0074f.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_How_Monero_hides_sender_s_identity_1201d0074f.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_How_Monero_hides_sender_s_identity_1201d0074f.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_How_Monero_hides_sender_s_identity_1201d0074f.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Ring signature design as illustrated by&nbsp;<a href=""https://messari.io/report/on-chain-privacy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Messari</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Stealth Address: Anonymizing Receivers</h3><p>Transaction linkability and address reuse are among the most exploited aspects in denonymizing users of Bitcoin. Even if a new public address is used to send every transaction, the links between them can be traced back to the original owner.</p><p>Monero proposes a solution where users may publicize a single public address and receive unconditional unlinkable payments on the address. It achieves this by sending every transaction output to a public address derived from the sender’s data and the recipient’s public address, called a&nbsp;<strong>stealth address.</strong></p><p>To send a transaction output, the sender first creates a one-time destination key using a part of the recipient’s public address and other critical cryptographic primitives. The sender publishes the output publicly. Now, users constantly scan all new transaction outputs with their public key.&nbsp;</p><p>The cryptographic primitives are designed such that the rightful recipient can claim their outputs in the network, effectively unlinking the transactions on Menoro.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Monero_Stealth_Transaction_Model_c85869d364.jpg"" alt=""Monero Stealth Transactions"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Monero_Stealth_Transaction_Model_c85869d364.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Monero_Stealth_Transaction_Model_c85869d364.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Monero_Stealth_Transaction_Model_c85869d364.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Monero_Stealth_Transaction_Model_c85869d364.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Monero stealth transaction model | Image via&nbsp;<a href=""https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/blob/master/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CryptoNote Whitepaper</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)</h3><p>Monero uses a cryptographic tool called&nbsp;<strong>confidential transactions</strong> to hide the amount of XMR transferred in each transaction. Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the transaction amounts; only the sender and receiver, who hold the necessary keys, can view the actual amounts.</p><p>RingCT combines the concepts of ring signatures and confidential transactions to hide both the sender’s identity and the transaction amount simultaneously. This enhancement ensures that transactions are verified and recorded on the blockchain while the sender, receiver, and amount remain private.</p><p>Feel free to check out our other resources on Monero if you want to get into the weeds of everything Monero-related:</p><ul><li><a href=""/guides/how-to-use-monero/"">How to Use Monero Guide</a></li><li><a href=""/mining/monero-home/"">How to Mine Monero</a></li><li><a href=""/education/mining-monero/"">Is Mining Monero Still Profitable?</a></li><li><a href=""/mining/best-monero-pools/"">Best Monero Mining Pools</a></li><li><a href=""/analysis/best-monero-wallets/"">Top Monero Wallets</a></li></ul><p>If you want Guy's take on Monero, that can be found in the video below:</p><figure class=""media""><div data-oembed-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7BP6hU7AQw""><div style=""position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7BP6hU7AQw"" style=""position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>Monero vs. Other Networks</h2><p>Blockchain designs are a game of tradeoffs. There is no “<a href=""/analysis/solving-blockchain-trilemma/"">have it all</a>” blockchain perfect for every use case while adhering to all ideal design principles. Monero is no exception. The privacy features it offers are at a cost; let us compare Monero, Bitcoin, and Ethereum for a deeper look.</p><h3>Transaction Speed</h3><p>Transactions on Monero are relatively fast. The average block time (time required to produce a new block) is two minutes. Monero reduces the likelihood of congestion and delayed transactions with its variable block size, which can accommodate more transactions if needed.</p><p>The block time of Bitcoin and Ethereum is 10 minutes and about 13 seconds on average. Bitcoin owes its slow block time to its power-hungry but robust consensus. While Ethereum transactions are faster, they are also more in number due to smart contract support.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>Transaction fees on Monero may vary with demand but are generally reasonable. The protocol can regulate fees by altering its block size to fit more or fewer transactions. The lack of smart contract support means only XMR transfers are possible on the chain, which helps keep fees down.</p><p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are known to have periods of escalated fees during high demand. Unlike Monero, Bitcoin operates within a limited block capacity, making fees a direct function of demand. The fees on Ethereum are gas-dependent, meaning the fee is regulated based on the processing power spent by the network in producing blocks. Bitcoin and Ethereum have a history of exorbitant fee spikes.</p><h3>Scalability</h3><p>Monero features an adaptive block size that adjusts to transaction volume, offering flexible scalability. Monero’s privacy design requires the address to be twice as large as Bitcoin's, and ring signatures combine multiple signatures into one.&nbsp;</p><p>The privacy features on Monero impose heavy storage requirements on Monero. While a variable block size helps with scalability, each transaction on Monero is significantly bulkier than in Ethereum or Bitcoin.</p><p>Ethereum and Bitcoin have transcended their monolithic design to improve scalability. <a href=""/technology/lightning-network/"">Lightning Network</a> on Bitcoin and the <a href=""/analysis/what-is-the-best-layer-2/"">layer-2 ecosystem</a> of Ethereum are some scalability solutions available today.</p><h3>Privacy</h3><p>Monero transactions are private by default. Ring signatures and stealth addresses are so great at obfuscating transactions a user needs to publicize their transactions to dilute privacy intentionally.</p><p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are pseudonymous, meaning transactions are traceable and public. However, Ethereum has the potential for programmed privacy with smart contracts, which Bitcoin lacks.</p><p><i><strong><u>Fun Fact:</u></strong></i> Monero has been so successful at remaining untraceable that the IRS <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">offered a $625,000 reward</a> in 2020 to anyone who could crack the anonymity features of XMR. To date, nobody has.</p><h3>Mining</h3><p>Monero is a POW blockchain like Bitcoin. The former deploys the RandomX mining algorithm, while the latter uses a SHA-256 algorithm. RandomX facilitates memory-based mining, which is not resource-intensive. In contrast, mining Bitcoin entails solving hash functions, best done with expensive and resource-hungry ASICs. Ethereum is a POS blockchain that replaces computational power with steep monetary requirements.</p><p>The variable block capacity and signature design make Monero a memory-heavy chain, imposing heavy resource requirements on nodes and potentially leading to centralization with time.</p><h2>How to Use Monero Anonymously&nbsp;</h2><p>Achieving absolute digital anonymity is a monumental feat. Everyday users like you and I cannot even begin to realize the traces we leave behind on the internet, even when we are confident about our anonymity.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, iterating the speculativeness of anonymity is essential to discuss before delving into this section. The steps and precautions described in the following text must not be considered absolute or infallible. I encourage users to perceive it more like a set of guidelines to help you conduct self-due diligence that achieves reliable anonymity in your setting. Let’s explore what it takes to be anonymous in Web3.</p><p>A general practice for anonymity and general online security is using a VPN to mask your identity and encrypt your internet communication. <a href=""https://go.coinbureau.com/expressvpn"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sign up for a good VPN</a> service before exploring the steps described below. A VPN will help you hide your IP address, which is essential for hiding your location and personal identity.</p><h3>Creating an Anonymous XMR Wallet</h3><p>You first need an anonymous XMR wallet to obtain, store, and transact XMR. Look for a wallet that respects user privacy and demands little or no personal information. Avoid online wallets and privately controlled wallets like the ones offered by centralized exchanges.</p><p>Cold hardware wallets are effective at maintaining anonymity. Many prominent wallet providers like&nbsp;<a href=""/analysis/ledger-nano-x-trezor-model-t/"">Ledger and Trezor</a> support XMR. You can also consider using Monero GUI or CLI from GetMonero.org. Explore our detailed&nbsp;guide on <a href=""/analysis/best-monero-wallets/"">Monero wallets</a> for more details.</p><p>Remember that when you buy a hardware wallet online, any identity you provide, like your name, email, address, or fiat payment channels, breaches anonymity to some extent, which is why I believe achieving absolute anonymity is extraordinarily difficult in the digital age.</p><h3>Obtaining XMR</h3><p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are the most convenient platforms for acquiring cryptocurrencies. The general practice involves registering with an exchange and buying crypto with fiat. Then, most exchanges allow withdrawals to on-chain wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>This centralized exchange (CEX) approach is a no-go for us. Most exchanges impose KYC requirements and AML (Anti Money Laundering) verifications, breaking anonymity. You could look for CEXs that do not demand KYC. Consider verifying the legitimacy of any KYC-less exchange you may find.</p><p>P2P exchanges connect buyers and sellers without offering exchange and custodial services themselves. Therefore, they can circumvent imposing KYC requirements on their users.&nbsp;<a href=""https://localmonero.co/?language=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Localmonero</a> is a well-known P2P exchange where you can buy XMR with various fiat and crypto options. Avoid fiat to protect anonymity; crypto options like BTC and ETH are ideal.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have some XMR, transfer it to a new address. Transferring to a new stealth address will break the link with our external purchase using stealth transactions. The process of sending XMR to yourself multiple times to obfuscate identity is called&nbsp;‘churning.’ You could also consider <a href=""/education/mining-monero/"">mining XMR</a> so that you never leave the Monero ecosystem and potentially leave digital traces following you.&nbsp;</p><h2>Risks of Using Monero</h2><p>Privacy-focused blockchain projects deal with considerable heat from regulatory authorities. They also have a history of facilitating illicit exchanges of money and goods worldwide. Some risks you should consider before using Monero are as follows:</p><h3>Regulatory Risk</h3><p>Given its privacy-centric nature, Monero has been associated with illicit activities such as money laundering and illegal transactions on the dark web, leading to increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies worldwide. In some countries, the use of privacy coins like Monero is heavily regulated or even banned. This regulatory risk could impact the value and usability of Monero.&nbsp;</p><h3>Market Volatility</h3><p>Like all cryptocurrencies, Monero is subject to high market volatility. The value of XMR can fluctuate wildly in a short period, which can lead to significant financial losses for investors who are not prepared for such volatility.</p><h3>Technological Risks</h3><p>Monero's privacy features rely on complex cryptographic techniques. If these techniques were to be compromised, they could expose user transaction data. Additionally, as with any digital asset, there's the risk of loss due to hacking, phishing, or other cyber attacks.</p><h3>Liquidity Risk</h3><p>Monero's controversial reputation may limit its adoption by mainstream businesses and consumers, affecting the coin's liquidity and making it harder to buy or sell without impacting the market price.</p><h3>Others Risks</h3><p>Using Monero requires a certain level of technical knowledge. Mistakes in handling wallet keys or transaction details can lead to irreversible loss of funds. Furthermore, as a POW protocol, Monero consumes energy, leading to environmental stress in running the network.</p><p><a href=""https://hub.coinbureau.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg"" alt=""Join-The-CoinBureau-Club-Inline-Banner.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><blockquote><p>""I don't want to live in a world where everything that I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity, love, or friendship is recorded"" - <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/edward-snowden-surveillance-excess-interview"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Edward Snowden.</a></p></blockquote><p>Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, famously highlighted the importance of privacy and anonymity in a world increasingly under surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Monero, a blockchain protocol fundamentally anchored to the principle of privacy, is a testament to Edward’s remarks. It is designed to obscure transactions to make them confidential and untraceable with cryptography. Monero provides a space for financial transactions without the intrusion of surveillance. The freedom from constant regulatory overwatch is an essential defense against conformity, obedience, and submission.&nbsp;</p><p>While it is impossible to predict the prospects of Monero with certainty, we can ponder the factors that may shape its near and distant future. As a cryptocurrency, it is subject to macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory crackdowns, and forces of supply and demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As a privacy-focused technology, it has a few trends going its way. Digital privacy is a growing concern, and demand for robust privacy-focused financial networks could increase. I also see Monero’s potential in privacy-focused industries, where the networks concern a specific class of individuals. For instance, corporations may use Monero as a private network of intra-department transfers. Legal services and healthcare might find Monero’s privacy appealing for personal connectivity of sensitive data that may not concern the general public. Monero's future is a balance between its prospects as a leading privacy coin and the challenges it faces from regulatory, environmental, and technological perspectives.</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Review/render-network-review/,Render Network Review: Next-Level Decentralized Computing,Review,"<p>I own a PlayStation VR 2 headset.

He sets the strategic vision for OTOY and is the chief architect of the company’s technology roadmap.</p><p>He made his first game at the age of 18 and went on to make the web's first 3D video game platform and licensed the software to a number of major companies including Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon and Microsoft.</p><p>In addition, Ari Emanuel, the CEO of sports and entertainment company Endeavor, and movie director JJ Abrams are advisers to the company.</p><h2>What's the Role of the Render Network Foundation?</h2><p>As the Render Network has evolved into one of the largest decentralized GPU computing and GPU cloud rendering networks in the world, it has introduced a decentralized governance framework, led by the <a href=""https://renderfoundation.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Render Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>The foundation considers it important that active and engaged network participants are rewarded with ownership of the network in order to ensure that the network continues to evolve in the direction that serves its users most effectively.</p><figure class=""image""><a href=""https://vimeo.com/231572056"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_fb33c3171b.png""></a><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://rendernetwork.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Rendernetwork.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Every member of the Render Network community is considered a part of the foundation, as long as they are active participants.</p><h2>How to Join Render Network?</h2><p>If you're looking to join Render Network, there are two ways you can go about it. You can either join as a node operator (lend GPU power) or as a creator. Let's explore the two!</p><h3>Node Operators</h3><p>Perhaps you bought the shiny new GPU to play games, but haven't been able to find any free time. If you have unused GPU power, you could rent it out via Render Network and earn some RNDR tokens for time spent rendering.</p><p>Once a creator confirms that the renders were successfully processed, you will receive your RNDR tokens. Payouts are made every 7 to 10 days in a consolidated transaction to save on transaction fees required to make payments on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>The network scores users based on their success rate and past performance. If node operators do not successfully process work, their reputation will take a hit. Node operators with higher reputation scores are assigned work faster than those with low scores, incentivizing them to maintain high success rates.</p><p>Render Network says you should only connect your node to the network when you are able to commit most of your GPU, RAM and CPU resources. If you have a lot of GPU-intensive background tasks running while processing renders on the Render Network, it may lead to job failures that will hurt your reputation score and may lead to a potential quarantining of your node.</p><h3>Creators</h3><p>If you're someone who makes digital visuals, you're a consumer or a ""creator"" in Render Network parlance.</p><p>Just like node operators, creators have to be cognizant of their reputation score as well. If creators reject work that is properly rendered, their reputation score is reduced. For creators, reputation scores are used to determine the amount of concurrent mining nodes a user can access at any given time. As a result, creators with higher reputation scores are able to process work faster.</p><p>If you have insufficient funds to process a job, you will have to add tokens to your account in order to submit the job. Also, if you run out of RNDR tokens in your account while your rendering is in progress, your job will be paused until more tokens are added to your account. There are two ways of adding funds:</p><ul><li><strong>RNDR Token:</strong> RNDR is Render Network's native token. These can be purchased and sold on exchanges.</li><li><strong>RNDR Credits:</strong> Unlike the token, RNDR credits can be purchased using PayPal and Stripe, directly through the Render Network portal on rndr.x.io. When a user purchases RNDR credits, they are backed by RNDR tokens that have been purchased off of an exchange by Render Network. This means that when a creator pays for a job using RNDR credits, node operators are paid out in RNDR tokens for their work.</li></ul><h2>How to Get Started as a Node Operator</h2><p>To become a node operator, there are certain hardware requirements you must meet:</p><ul><li>A CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU and a minimum of CUDA 10.1 drivers with support for compute capability 3.0 or higher (the minimum driver version is 419). Render recommends at least 6GB of VRAM, and over 8GB VRAM.</li><li>RAM helps your node process more complex scenes, which means the higher your RAM, the more computing power your node can take on. Render recommends more than 32GB RAM.</li><li>Strong network connectivity is required to download and upload assets.</li><li>100 GB of free disk space is recommended.</li></ul><h3>Connecting your Node to the Render Network</h3><p>To join the network as a node operator, you must first complete a form, and you will be added to the onboarding queue.</p><p>Once your node is ready to start mining, the Render Network team will detail everything in an email, but here's a top-level view:</p><ul><li>Download and install the application sent to you by the Render Network team. Information for setting up your node will be included in the email.</li><li>Once you're all set, open and run the Render Network client. At this point, you will have to add your Ethereum wallet. It's important that you link the same wallet you shared previously with the Render Network team. Once you copy your ETH Wallet ID, click ""Set wallet ID."" If you do not see this popup in your taskbar, check your security and firewall settings.</li></ul><h2>How to Get Started as a Creator</h2><p>To get started on the creator portal, you must have an active OctaneRender license or a subscription, which is currently €23.95 per month (billed annually) or €239.88 annually, which comes out to €19.99 per month. If you own a subscription or have a license, you can start rendering at rndr.x.io, where you log in with your OTOY account.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OTOY_Login_704c1c4ded.jpg"" alt=""OTOY Login.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OTOY_Login_704c1c4ded.jpg 160w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OTOY_Login_704c1c4ded.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>OTOY is Render Network's Parent Company. Image via Render Network</figcaption></figure><p>This is what a creator's journey looks like on Render Network:</p><ul><li><strong>Checking Octane Version:</strong> The Render Network supports the most stable versions of OctaneRender.</li><li><strong>Exporting to ORBX file format:</strong> To upload a scene to the Render Network, the scene needs to be exported as an ORBX file, using OctaneRender Standalone or any of the supported OctaneRender plugin integrations. Checking a scene and optimizing it in Octane Standalone before it is uploaded to the Render Network is recommended to avoid errors, re-renders or unnecessary costs.</li><li><strong>Create Job Parameters for Rendering:</strong> When you have a scene to render, you can create a job. To begin this process click the “Create a Job” button on your scene. You will be redirected to the “Create a Job” page, where you will have several options.</li><li><strong>Estimate Job Costs:</strong> The final step before rendering is generating a cost estimate. This is to avoid the final job cost exceeding the number of tokens that were temporarily held for rendering. If the amount of work exceeds the number of tokens/credits in your account, the render will be paused and you will be prompted to add more tokens/credits to your account to resume the render.</li></ul><h2>How Much Does RNDR Cost?</h2><p>Render Network has a multi-tier pricing structure, based around speed, security and cost.</p><p>Both the RNDR token and credit are mapped to a unit of work called OctaneBench, a tool created by OTOY to define the computing power provided by any combination of graphics cards into a single score. When setting up a job, creators select a tier based on their preferences for speed, cost, security and node reputation.</p><p>Render Network currently has two pricing tiers:</p><ul><li><strong>Tier 1 (Priority):</strong> This provides rendering queue priority, more power and faster average speeds to handle larger and more complex scenes.</li><li><strong>Tier 2 (Economy):</strong> Provides the most economic rendering solution. Queue priority and requisite node power are not guaranteed. This tier is recommended for work that is not time-sensitive.</li></ul><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/RNDR_pricing_7def91950c.jpg"" alt=""RNDR pricing.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_RNDR_pricing_7def91950c.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_RNDR_pricing_7def91950c.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_RNDR_pricing_7def91950c.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Render Network Has a Multi-Tier Pricing Structure. Image via Render Network</figcaption></figure><p>The company is also currently working on another tier called ""Trusted."" Once that's rolled out, that'll become Tier 1.</p><p>Multi-tier pricing operates using a multiplier attached to the OctaneBench algorithm.</p><ul><li>Tier 1 (Trusted) work has an OctaneBench multiplier of 1x.</li><li>Tier 2 (Priority) has a multiplier that varies between 2x and 4x (thus, an artist will receive 2x to 4x more OB work at Tier 2 when compared to Tier 1).</li><li>Tier 3 (Economy) has a multiplier of 8x to 16x when compared to Tier 1.</li></ul><h2>RNDR Token</h2><p>RNDR is an ERC-20 utility token designed to power rendering work on the Render Network. RNDR tokens can be purchased and sold on exchanges and can be earned by node operators for work rendered on their nodes.</p><p>This is what the RNDR token allocation looks like:</p><ul><li>25% has been sold</li><li>10% is in the RNDR reserve</li><li>65% is in escrow for supply/demand flowback to the network</li></ul><p>As the network scales, Render says it will need to flow more tokens into the ecosystem. These tokens will either come through the reserve as user acquisitions, bonuses for node operators, airdrops, or other future token allocation methods. In the meantime, these tokens are sitting in a third-party custody and escrow account.</p><p>Render Network has undertaken two token sales:</p><ul><li>A public sale in October 2017 where 1 RNDR token was equivalent to $0.25.</li><li>A private sale from January to May 2018 where 1 RNDR token equalled $0.25.</li></ul><p>The token's price has come a long way since.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/RNDR_token_price_5eba34c716.jpg"" alt=""RNDR token price.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_RNDR_token_price_5eba34c716.jpg 197w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_RNDR_token_price_5eba34c716.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_RNDR_token_price_5eba34c716.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>RNDR is the 57th Largest Token by Market Capitalization.

Just like every other business, it too faces its own set of unique challenges.</p><h3>Combining Blockchain and AI</h3><p>While the two technologies hold immense promise, they also present challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Blockchain networks are inherently transparent, which can conflict with the privacy requirements of certain AI applications. Ensuring that sensitive data used by AI algorithms remains private and secure while being processed within a transparent and immutable blockchain is a complex problem.</li><li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Integrating diverse AI algorithms and blockchain platforms can be challenging due to the lack of standardized protocols. Ensuring seamless communication and data exchange between different AI models and various blockchain networks is a technical hurdle.</li><li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Blockchain networks are touted for their security, but they are not immune to attacks. <a href=""/education/ethereum-smart-contracts/"">Smart contracts</a>, which are integral to Render Network, can contain vulnerabilities that AI-driven attacks might exploit. Ensuring the security of both the blockchain infrastructure and the AI algorithms is paramount.</li></ul><h3>Regulatory Risks</h3><p>Operating in a decentralized environment, especially within the world of emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, brings with it regulatory uncertainty and legal risks.</p><p>Many governments and regulatory bodies, especially the U.S., have yet to establish comprehensive guidelines and laws specific to decentralized platforms. This lack of clear regulations creates uncertainty, making it challenging for businesses and individuals to understand legal obligations and potential liabilities.</p><p>Render Network transcends traditional geographical boundaries. This makes determining which jurisdiction's laws apply in the case of disputes or legal matters becomes complex. Different countries have varying regulations regarding blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized applications, which may lead to conflicts in legal interpretation and enforcement.</p><p>AML and KYC regulations are stringent in the financial sector to prevent money laundering and illicit activities. Ensuring compliance with these regulations in decentralized environments, where transactions are pseudonymous, poses significant challenges.</p><h3>Competitors</h3><p><a href=""https://www.golem.network/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Golem Network</a> is another company that works more or less like Render Network.</p><p>Golem is a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use. It is made up of the combined computing power of users' machines, from PCs to entire data centres. To facilitate that exchange, Golem implements a decentralized marketplace where IT resources are rented out. The participants in this decentralized network can assume one of the following two roles:</p><ul><li><strong>Requestor:</strong> This is someone with a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware.</li><li><strong>Provider:</strong> Someone who has free IT resources that can be shared with others in the network.</li></ul><p>The main difference between Golem and Render is that the former focuses on a wide range of use cases such as CGI rendering, scientific calculations, and machine learning, and while Render does all that too, its main focus is on AR, VR and MR.</p><h2>What is the Future of Render Network?</h2><p>Right now, bolstering the Render Network's capacity, finishing the Render Network SDK, providing Arnold support (via Hydra in the Render Network SDK), and validating some non-RNDR apps are the company's main priorities. Once these are done, the company has some interesting ideas:</p><ul><li><a href=""/review/siacoin-everything-need-know/""><strong>SiaCoin</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is a project the Render Network team has kept on its radar for a number of years, and the possibility of integration has been discussed.</li><li><a href=""/review/basic-attention-token-bat/""><strong>Basic Attention Token</strong></a><strong>:</strong> BAT's technology for mapping ads and ad viewership has been discussed as a framework for potential Render Network development in ray-casting ad topology across virtual 3D spaces.</li><li><a href=""/review/decentraland-mana/""><strong>Decentraland</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The metaverse gaming app is on the company's radar as well.</li></ul><h2>Render Network: Closing Thoughts</h2><p>Render Network solves the challenges faced by creators in the virtual realm. By offering decentralized GPU computing power through blockchain technology, Render Network revolutionizes 3D rendering and computational tasks. The platform minimizes GPU wastage while providing on-demand rendering solutions in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>For Render Network, scalability, efficiency, and commitment to digital rights management is the name of the game.

The primary difference lies in the currency used within these test networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of real Ether (ETH), they use test Ether tokens, often referred to as ""Testnet Ether"" or ""test ETH."" These test Ether tokens are supposed to hold no actual monetary value as they can be obtained without any cost, allowing users to engage in various activities without the fear of losing real funds. Testnet ETH is also designed to be free or cheap to acquire as it allows developers to make lots of test transactions at virtually no cost.</p><p>Although Testnet ETH should be valueless as it can be created with relative ease, there are actually secondary markets that exist where Testnet ETH does have a surprisingly high market value as they have become scarce or hard to obtain.</p><p>An example of this would be <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#:~:text=Goerli%20is%20a%20testnet%20for,stakers%20can%20test%20network%20upgrades"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goerli ETH</a> which is facing deprecation and at the time of writing is trading at $0.03312 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1668.</p><p>As stated by Coingecko:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Goerli Testnet is one of Ethereum Chain's many Testnets that serves as a test environment for Ethereum developers and is facing deprecation.

They enable experimentation, testing and exploration of smart contracts, <a href=""/analysis/best-ethereum-dapps/"">decentralized applications</a> (DApps) and other blockchain features without the financial risks associated with the mainnet.</p><h2>How do Testnets Work?</h2><p>Testnets come in a variety of flavours, with the most common being <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#:~:text=Goerli%20is%20a%20testnet%20for,stakers%20can%20test%20network%20upgrades"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Rinkeby</a>, <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#:~:text=Goerli%20is%20a%20testnet%20for,stakers%20can%20test%20network%20upgrades"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goerli</a>, <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#:~:text=Goerli%20is%20a%20testnet%20for,stakers%20can%20test%20network%20upgrades"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sepolia</a> and more recently, <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#:~:text=Goerli%20is%20a%20testnet%20for,stakers%20can%20test%20network%20upgrades"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Holesky</a>. Each Testnet offers a slightly different environment to cater to specific testing needs. For instance, Ropsten (now deprecated) used a <a href=""/analysis/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/"">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to the old mainnet, while Rinkeby employs a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism and Goerli combines aspects of both. Developers can choose the Testnet that best suits their project's requirements.</p><p>Accessing a Testnet typically involves using specialized wallets or development tools. Once connected, users can create and deploy smart contracts, interact with DApps, simulate transactions, and test various blockchain-related functionalities. The open nature of Testnets fosters collaboration, community feedback and iterative development, ultimately contributing to the stability and security of applications before they are deployed on the main Ethereum network.&nbsp;</p><p>Ethereum Testnets are essential components of the Ethereum ecosystem that allow developers to test and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) without using real Ether (ETH) on the main Ethereum network and serve as a safe environment for experimentation. Here's how Ethereum Testnets work:</p><ul><li><strong>Testnet Networks</strong>: Ethereum has multiple Testnet networks, each serving a different purpose. The most commonly used Testnets include Holesky, Goerli and Sepolia. Each of these networks mimics the Ethereum mainnet to varying degrees but uses Testnet Ether, which has no real-world value.</li><li><strong>Testnet Ether (tETH)</strong>: Testnets have their own native cryptocurrency called ""Testnet Ether"" (tETH) or other Testnet-specific tokens. These tokens are freely available and can be obtained from faucets or other Testnet resources. Unlike real Ether, tETH is usually distributed for free and has no monetary value.</li><li><strong>Similar Blockchain Structure</strong>: Testnets replicate the structure of the Ethereum mainnet, including block generation, transaction processing and smart contract execution. They use the same underlying technology, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the same consensus algorithms (proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, depending on the Testnet).</li><li><a href=""https://goethereumbook.org/en/faucets/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Faucets</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Testnet Ether can be obtained from faucets, which are online tools that distribute tETH for free. Users often need to provide a Testnet address to receive the tokens. Faucets are available for each Testnet and developers can use them to acquire tETH for testing.</li><li><a href=""https://etherscan.io/gastracker"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Gas Fees</strong></a>: Just like the mainnet, Testnets require gas fees to process transactions and execute smart contracts. However, since tETH has no real-world value, the gas fees are minuscule and affordable. Developers need tETH to pay for gas when testing their applications.</li></ul><figure class=""image image_resized"" style=""width:50%;""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Rinkeby_e637276b63.jpg"" alt=""Rinkeby testnet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Rinkeby_e637276b63.jpg 88w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Rinkeby_e637276b63.jpg 281w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Rinkeby Testnet Transaction, Image via <a href=""https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/117950/why-is-gas-fee-of-mainnet-higher-than-testnet"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">StackExchange</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Development and Testing</strong>: Developers can deploy smart contracts and DApps on Testnets using the same tools and methodologies they would use on the mainnet. They can test their code, simulate interactions, and ensure that everything works as expected without risking real Ether.</li><li><strong>Community Support</strong>: Testnets have active developer communities that provide support, information, and resources to help developers navigate the testing environment. You can find <a href=""https://sepolia.etherscan.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Testnet block explorers</a>, forums, and other tools to monitor and interact with the Testnet.</li><li><strong>Network Upgrades</strong>: Testnets are periodically upgraded to test new Ethereum protocol upgrades and changes before they are implemented on the mainnet. Developers and network validators participate in these upgrades to ensure they are safe and effective. Examples include the already implemented <a href=""https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559</a> so called EIP1559 which introduced a fee burning mechanism.</li><li><strong>Resetting and Pruning</strong>: Testnets may be reset or pruned periodically to maintain their performance and cleanliness. This means that Testnet data can be erased, and tETH balances can be reset to prevent accumulation and misuse.</li></ul><p>Ethereum Testnets provide a controlled and risk-free environment for developers to experiment with Ethereum smart contracts and DApps. They mimic the mainnet's functionality while using Testnet-specific tokens that have no real value, making it a safe space for development and testing.</p><h2>What Are Different Testnets Used For?</h2><p>Each Testnet will be designed for specific use cases or developer needs, as such, different Testnets will be used by different people for different tasks. Let’s break them down and take a look:</p><h3>Sepolia Testnet</h3><p>Sepolia is a Testnet primarily designed for developers and testers who want to interact with the Ethereum network without the constraints and complexities of the mainnet. &nbsp;Sepolia is the recommended default Testnet for application development and was designed to simulate harsh network conditions. Sepolia offers the following benefits and features:</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li><strong>Sepolia is suggested as the default Testnet:</strong> Developers who are building applications on a specific blockchain platform are recommended to use Sepolia. It’s designed for testing decentralized applications, smart contracts and other EVM functionality.</li><li><strong>Permissioned Validator Set</strong>: The Sepolia network employs a permissioned validator set. In a permissioned network, validators are chosen and controlled by specific entities, often client teams and testing teams. These validators are responsible for confirming and adding new transactions to the blockchain. Having a permissioned validator set provides more control and security, making it suitable for testing and development purposes.</li><li><strong>New Testnet with Small State and History</strong>: Sepolia is described as a relatively new Testnet. This means that it hasn't been in existence for very long, and as a result, the blockchain's state (current data and account balances) and history (past transactions and events) are quite small. This is in contrast to older Testnets or the mainnet, which may have accumulated a large amount of data over time.</li><li><strong>Quick to Sync</strong>: Because Sepolia's state and history are small, it's much quicker to synchronize (sync) with the network. Syncing refers to the process of downloading and updating a node's copy of the blockchain to match the current state of the network. In Sepolia's case, this process is fast and efficient.</li><li><strong>Minimal Disk Space Requirement</strong>: Running a node on the Sepolia Testnet doesn't require a lot of storage space. This is advantageous for developers who want to set up a node quickly and interact with the network directly without having to allocate a significant amount of disk space for storage.</li></ul><h3>Holesky Testnet (Replacing Goerli in 2023):</h3><p>Holesky is replacing Goerli as a Testnet for staking, infrastructure and protocol development and went live on 28 September 2023. Holesky is an impressive new Testnet and is the first long-standing, merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum Testnet whose main function is to replace Goerli as a staking, infrastructure and protocol-developer Testnet in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Holesky is specifically designed for thorough staking trials, infrastructure assessments and direct protocol developer testing, mirroring mainnet functionalities for precise evaluations.</p><p>Holesky aims to increase the number of validators on the Ethereum mainnet and test how changes affect its stability. The Ethereum Foundation’s DevOps team has several plans for Holesky.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Test the network more thoroughly by having twice as many active validators as the main Ethereum network.</li><li>Improve the way inflation works using methods from the Sepolia testnet.</li><li>Start with a strong base of 1 million validators for better testing.</li><li>Encourage teams to run many of these validators, aiming for each team to handle around 100,000, ensuring the testnet works as intended.</li></ol><h3>Goerli Testnet</h3><p>Goerli is a widely used Ethereum Testnet with the following key purposes:</p><ul><li><strong>Open Validator Set</strong>: Goerli features an open validator set, allowing <a href=""/education/guide-to-staking-crypto/"">stakers</a> to participate and test network upgrades. This openness makes it suitable for developers and projects interested in testing their staking setups.</li><li><strong>Large State</strong>: Goerli has a larger state compared to some other Testnets, which is useful for testing complex smart contract interactions and scenarios that require a substantial amount of data.</li><li><strong>Longer Sync and Storage Requirements</strong>: Because of its larger state, Goerli may take longer to sync and requires more storage space to run a node. This means it's better suited for users who require a more comprehensive testing environment and are willing to invest in the necessary resources.</li></ul><p>In summary, Ethereum Testnets are specialized networks designed for specific use cases and developer needs. They cater to different tasks and audiences.&nbsp;</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li>The Sepolia Testnet, recommended for application development, offers benefits like a permissioned validator set, a small state and history, quick synchronization and minimal disk space requirements.&nbsp;</li><li>Holešky Testnet, replacing Goerli in 2023, focuses on staking, infrastructure, and protocol development, aiming to be the first long-standing public Ethereum Testnet.</li><li>Goerli Testnet is widely used and features an open validator set and a large state but requires longer sync times and more storage space.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These Testnets serve distinct purposes, allowing developers and users to test various Ethereum network aspects based on their specific needs and resource availability. The choice of Testnet depends on your testing requirements and resource constraints.</p><h2>Why Are Testnets Useful?</h2><p>Ethereum Testnets are often overshadowed by the mainnet's spotlight but they play a pivotal role in the world of blockchain and Ethereum ecosystem development. They serve as invaluable sandboxes for developers and stakeholders alike, offering a controlled environment to experiment, test, and refine <a href=""https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum-based applications</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, Testnets are instrumental in mitigating risks associated with deploying <a href=""/education/ethereum-smart-contracts/"">smart contracts</a> and decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum mainnet. The blockchain ecosystem is a high-stakes arena, with real-world assets and substantial economic value at risk. By allowing developers to deploy and assess their creations on Testnets, the Ethereum community can identify vulnerabilities, bugs and security loopholes before they potentially wreak havoc on the mainnet. This risk mitigation aspect is pivotal in preserving the integrity and trustworthiness of the Ethereum network.</p><p>In the fast-paced world of blockchain, developers are constantly innovating and iterating their projects. Testnets provide a rapid and cost-effective means to validate ideas and deploy prototypes. Without the burden of real-value transactions, developers can experiment freely, implement upgrades, and fine-tune their codebase with agility. This accelerated development cycle on Testnets not only reduces time-to-market but also fosters a culture of innovation, ensuring that Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain technology.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/testnet_ETH_pic_26dbc45695.jpg"" alt=""testnet ETH "" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_testnet_ETH_pic_26dbc45695.jpg 165w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_testnet_ETH_pic_26dbc45695.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Image via <a href=""https://www.argent.xyz/learn/how-to-get-testnet-eth-for-starknet/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Argent</a></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Testnets are powerful tools for community collaboration. Ethereum is built on the principle of decentralization and a vibrant ecosystem of developers, enthusiasts and stakeholders. Testnets create a common ground where this diverse community can collaborate, test new features, and provide feedback. Developers can engage with the broader Ethereum community, seeking input and insights that can enhance their projects. This open and collaborative approach ensures that Ethereum evolves in a direction that benefits its users and maintains community-driven governance.</p><p>Ethereum Testnets are far more than just staging grounds for developers; they are indispensable pillars of the Ethereum ecosystem. They play a pivotal role in risk mitigation by identifying vulnerabilities early, facilitating accelerated development by providing a safe playground for innovation and fostering community collaboration by encouraging open dialogue and feedback. As <a href=""/analysis/decoding-ethereum/"">Ethereum continues to evolve</a>, Testnets will remain a cornerstone of its success, ensuring that it remains a secure, innovative and community-driven blockchain platform.</p><h2>What is the Future of Ethereum Testnets?</h2><p>The Ethereum community is facing a challenge with the rapid deprecation of Testnets, causing frustration among application developers and infrastructure providers. To address this issue, <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-predictable-ethereum-testnet-lifecycle/11575"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a proposal</a> has emerged from discussions within the Testnet workgroup. The proposal aims to create a more predictable Ethereum Testnet Lifecycle, providing stability and clarity for all stakeholders in the ecosystem.</p><p>The central idea of the proposal is to establish a predictable schedule for launching and maintaining Ethereum Testnets. Here are the key points:</p><ol><li><strong>New Testnets Every Two Years</strong>: Ethereum would launch a new Testnet every two years on a predefined date, such as October 1st, 2023, 2025, 2027, and so on.</li><li><strong>Testnet Lifetime Limit</strong>: Testnets will have a maximum lifetime of five years, comprising four years of active testing and one additional year of long-term support if necessary.</li><li><strong>Goerli Support Extension</strong>: Depending on the outcome of discussions regarding supply issues, Goerli's long-term support may be extended for another two years until 2024.</li></ol><p>The current approach of abruptly deprecating multiple Testnets with little notice ahead of the merge has caused frustration. Currently, only two major Testnets are available: Goerli (permissionless) and Sepolia (permissioned). Goerli has attracted more users due to its better infrastructure, creating a network effect.</p><p>The proposal suggests limiting the lifetime of public Ethereum Testnets to four years after genesis, with the possibility of extending it by one year for heavily used networks, reaching a maximum of five years.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, a new Testnet will be launched every two years. This ensures that at least two public Testnets will always be available to all stakeholders, reducing the frequency of application migrations to every four years.</p><p>The Predictable Ethereum Testnet Lifecycle proposal aims to bring stability and predictability to the Ethereum Testnet ecosystem. By establishing a clear schedule for launching and maintaining Testnets, it seeks to reduce frustration among application developers and infrastructure providers, ensuring a smoother transition for the Ethereum community during network upgrades and changes.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/timeline_5d7dc72faa.jpg"" alt=""timeline.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_timeline_5d7dc72faa.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_timeline_5d7dc72faa.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_timeline_5d7dc72faa.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_timeline_5d7dc72faa.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Timeline of Ethereum Testnet Lifecycles, Image via <a href=""https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a></figcaption></figure><h2>Summary</h2><p>Ethereum Testnets serve as crucial elements in the world of blockchain development, providing a secure and controlled environment that benefits both developers and users.

The first two are concepts within the Tron network that are used to operate the blockchain and keep things fast and cheap. <strong>Bandwidth</strong> is used to offset the transaction fees on Tron and <strong>Energy</strong> is needed to interact with the smart contracts on the Tron network.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.stakingrewards.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Stakingrewards.com</a>, the current yield for staked TRX is 3.45%. That's not too bad considering that ETH gives you 3.76% these days.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/ETH_TRX_Staking_Yield_3561b220f9.png"" alt=""Where to buy Tron"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_ETH_TRX_Staking_Yield_3561b220f9.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_ETH_TRX_Staking_Yield_3561b220f9.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_ETH_TRX_Staking_Yield_3561b220f9.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_ETH_TRX_Staking_Yield_3561b220f9.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>ETH's Yield Edges Out the Yield for Staked TRX.

Some of them allow for purchases of TRX using fiat currency which needs to be deposited on the exchange first. Decentralised exchanges like <a href=""/review/uniswap-uni/"">Uniswap</a> let you swap <a href=""/guides/guide-to-stablecoins/"">stablecoins</a> (<a href=""/education/what-is-tether-usdt/"">USDT</a>, <a href=""/education/what-is-the-usdc-stablecoin/"">USDC</a> etc.) for TRX on their platform.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left:!important;"">A quick note here: Decentralized exchanges require no KYC but you will need to have some level of understanding about crypto to interact with them. If you are completely new to the crypto scene, a centralized exchange could be a good choice but you will need to give up just a bit of your privacy in order to use them.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left:!important;"">Also for newbies, we have a <a href=""/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/"">cryptocurrency beginner's guide</a> that explains the digital asset class in plain English.</p><h2>How to buy TRX in 5 Steps</h2><p>Getting your cash converted into crypto is not as hard as you may think. Nowadays, there are quite a few ways to do this safely and relatively easily.</p><p>Centralized exchanges are one of the most popular places to buy crypto, including TRX. Note that these exchanges usually require their customers to undergo a KYC process. For those who are more privacy-minded, you might want to skip this section and move on to the next one.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 1: Choosing a platform</h3><p>We've given you some ideas on the best exchanges to buy TRX. As long as it is an exchange that's been around for at least five years, has proof of reserves, has gone through audit checks, and may even be regulated in certain jurisdictions, these are usually the more reputable exchanges you can consider. Some of them may not operate in the region you are in, so please check this carefully before signing up for an account with them.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 2: Do KYC</h3><p>The next step is usually to undergo the KYC process, often required by regulators. They'll likely ask for some form of ID and proof of address as a basic requirement. This step can take a few minutes or several days, depending on the exchange.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 3: Deposit Funds</h3><p>After having successfully opened an account, it's time to move some money into it. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully when filling out the bank details for making a deposit. Check that all the required fields are entered correctly, including any reference numbers needed to accompany the bank transfer. Incorrect details may lead to delays in crediting the funds to your account, or worse still, having the funds returned to your bank. Some exchanges might also have deposit minimums, so check before making the transfer.</p><h3>Step 4: Place an Order&nbsp;</h3><p>Hooray, your funds are credited and you're ready to convert your cash into TRX. Exchanges consider this a “trade” since you are trading cash for crypto. There are two common ways to place an order:</p><ul><li><strong>Market orders:</strong> A market order means you are ready to trade at whatever price the crypto happens to be at the time. These orders are usually processed instantly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Limit orders:</strong> These let you set the price you want to buy TRX at. For example, the current price of TRX is around $0.088. If you think this price is too high and are more comfortable buying it at $0.06, that's the price you enter in the order. Anytime the market price matches the price you want, that's when the order is fulfilled.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Step 5: You have TRX!&nbsp;</h3><p>Once the TRX is credited to your account, the next thing to consider is where to store it. Exchanges allow you to store your balance because it's easy for you to make trades. However, these funds are in the custody of the exchange, which means if it goes bust a la FTX or if there's a major hack, you may end up losing your money. For more on protecting your digital tokens, check out our <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">crypto safety guide</a>.</p><p>If you don't intend to trade TRX, it's much better to store it in a non-custodial wallet. More on this later in the article.</p><h2>How to Buy TRX with a Debit or Credit Card</h2><p>Aside from exchanges, you can also buy TRX with plastic. Granted, most of the exchanges will also offer this service but the fees are considerably higher than if you were to make a trade. Also, if you don't want to undergo the KYC process, exchanges may not be the right place for you. Here are some alternate considerations:</p><ul><li><strong>Crypto shops:</strong> These are very niche, and I came across them in my early crypto days. One example of a crypto shop is <a href=""https://easycrypto.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">EasyCrypto</a>, where you can buy crypto, and they ask you for a wallet address to send the crypto to. The platform is connected with the local payment provider Windcave, which gives you access to either pay by bank transfer or via credit card. You do need to set up an account with them to get started. They don't store your crypto, which means you need to have a wallet address ready to send the funds to.</li><li><strong>Buy directly from the wallet:</strong> Some wallets like <a href=""/review/trust-wallet/"">Trust Wallet</a>, <a href=""/review/exodus-wallet/"">Exodus</a>, and <a href=""/review/ledger-nano-s-plus-review/#nano-s-plus-vs-nano-x"">Ledger</a> allow you to buy crypto directly from their own interface. This saves you the hassle of having to transfer them to another place after you've bought them.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Below are the basic steps to buying TRX with your debit/credit card:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into the platform of your choice.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image image_resized"" style=""width:47.49%;""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Buy_TRX_CC_b125641aa6.png"" alt=""Buy _TRX_CC"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Buy_TRX_CC_b125641aa6.png 205w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Buy_TRX_CC_b125641aa6.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Buy_TRX_CC_b125641aa6.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Buy_TRX_CC_b125641aa6.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Funds Are Directly Deposited into the Ledger Wallet.

This is a cold wallet, one of the best ways to safely store your crypto. When it comes to interacting with DApps though, hot wallets (internet-enabled and online) are a better choice. We've covered our <a href=""/analysis/best-tron-dapps/"">top Tron DApps</a> as well.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left:!important;"">You can think of a cold wallet as a bank vault and a hot wallet as your checking account if that helps you visualize the differences.</p><p style=""margin-left:!important;"">A popular wallet for TRX is <a href=""https://www.tronlink.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TronLink</a>, which fully supports the Tron network. It boasts over 10 million users and is available is more than 200 countries.

While it's true that you need to do some research regarding which wallet you want to use, the actual steps involved in purchasing TRX are super easy if you're using a card.&nbsp;</p><p>The downside to using debit or credit cards is the expensive fees since this is a service provided by the payment providers. The business models for these companies are fee-based, hence you might be paying an arm and a leg to use them. The other thing is that you can't pick and choose the price you want to buy unless you wait for the market rate to be aligned with your price of choice.</p><p>On the other hand, while trading cash for crypto on an exchange is a lot cheaper fee-wise, a certain amount of patience is required as you wait for the funds to be transferred from your bank account to theirs. If all goes well, this is a fairly quick transfer that requires less than a day. In some instances, however, it could take up to a week or more, something I know far too well from personal experience. With limit orders, you have the option of buying at a price that you find favourable, especially if you're in no hurry to obtain it, or the price you want is not too far from the current market rate.</p><p>However you choose to make your purchase, we hope that this article gives you an idea of where to buy TRX in a manner that best suits your preferences.&nbsp;</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Analysis/ellipal-vs-ngrave-review/,ELLIPAL Titan vs. NGRAVE ZERO: Hardware Wallets Compared!,Analysis,https://www.coinbureau.com/Review/alethea-ai-review/,Alethea Review 2023: A Deep Dive into Artificial Liquid Intelligence (ALI),Review,"<p>Just as the internet revolutionized content distribution, AI is bringing a new era in content creation to the fore.&nbsp;</p><p>The emergence of powerful large language models like ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft's Bing, among others, points to a massive shift in creative possibilities.

This hurdle often results in AI-crypto projects having centralized elements.</p><p>Alethea AI bridges this gap. Instead of burdening decentralized networks with AI computations, the company takes a unique approach. It keeps AI processing off-chain while harnessing the power of <a href=""/education/ethereum-smart-contracts/"">smart contracts</a> on the <a href=""/education/what-is-ethereum/"">Ethereum blockchain</a> to support its protocol layer, a foundation crucial for the creation of iNFTs (more on that later. A LOT more).</p><p>Alethea AI's vision is to preserve and evolve human culture, stories, and collective intelligence. How does it plan to go about it? By combining AI-generated personalities with NFTs to craft intelligent NFT avatars. These entities serve a dual purpose: they not only act as guardians of the cultures that inspired their creation but also offer people an opportunity to delve deep into collective intelligence as they interact with these imaginative and self-sufficient iNFTs.</p><p>The company is backed by some big names in the crypto industry, including <a href=""/review/binance/"">Binance</a>, <a href=""/education/polygon-2023-beginners-guide-to-matic/"">Polygon</a> and <a href=""/review/crypto-com-exchange/"">Crypto.com</a>.

Image via Alethea AI</figcaption></figure><p>The iNFT Protocol refers to a set of smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain that allows anyone to create iNFTs in a permissionless manner. Any NFT can be turned into an iNFT via the iNFT Protocol. This is achieved by fusing the NFT with another ERC-721 asset called the Personality Pod. Once the NFT is fused with a Personality Pod, it acquires its own unique intelligence and personality. This is because the Personality Pod comprises various on-chain personality traits that shape the overall personality of the iNFT and in doing so, dictate the iNFT's intelligence.</p><p>The iNFT Protocol is designed with a non-custodial framework. Such an architecture enables users to turn their NFTs into iNFTs without the protocol requiring custody (locking, staking, wrapping, swapping) or applying other changes to the underlying NFT. As a result, users can utilize their NFTs outside the iNFT Protocol and reduce the risks of losing their valuable NFTs by an error, or an attack on the smart contracts of the iNFT Protocol.</p><h3>CharacterGPT</h3><p>Imagine talking to a computer and it creates characters that not only look real but also sound and act like real people or creatures. Alethea AI's CharacterGPT is all about bringing characters to life, just by using words. This technology has just received a significant upgrade.</p><p>With this new version, called CharacterGPT V2, you can create characters that are incredibly lifelike. They have detailed appearances, unique voices, and distinct personalities. But that's not all — CharacterGPT V2 is now smarter and understands what you want better than ever before.</p><p>CharacterGPT V2 can be accessed via a website called MyCharacter.ai, where you can create, customize, and bring to life a wide range of characters — all that's required is a simple text input.</p><p>CharacterGPT V2 and MyCharacter.ai offer an exciting playground to unleash your imagination, and I did exactly that albeit with mixed results.</p><p><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/My_Character_942270a7ed.jpg"" alt=""MyCharacter.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_My_Character_942270a7ed.jpg 208w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_My_Character_942270a7ed.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_My_Character_942270a7ed.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></p><p>I fashioned my character after John Wick, protagonist of the American media franchise <i>John Wick,</i> played by Keanu Reeves in the movies.</p><p>John Wick is a legendary globetrotting bad-guy-buster.

Here's the answer: If I were John Wick, my next mission would be to open my own wellness centre and bring the healing power of massage therapy to a larger community.</p><p>I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Here was this fearsome, gun-wielding, world-saving hero, and his mission for the day was to transform into a spa magician.</p><p>Also, the eyes!</p><p>That all said, however, it appears my version of John Wick was pre-assigned the personality of a “compassionate and skilled massage therapist."" So, I asked him another question: I just returned from the gym and my muscles are a little sore. Which massage is best for my situation? In response, I was told to get a deep tissue massage. Right on, Mr. Wick!</p><h3>AI Protocol and DApps</h3><p>The AI Protocol provides permissionless access to generative AI systems and allows creators and developers to leverage new monetization models, user acquisition, interoperability, verification, crowdsourcing, governance and provenance.</p><p>The AI Protocol unlocks the benefits of ownership for those seeking to build generative AI applications. On top of the powerful AI systems in its Intelligence Layer, the AI Protocol offers a suite of tools for anyone looking to build AI-powered DApps: no-code smart contracts deployment, gasless transactions, cross-blockchain compatibility, non-custodial wallet creation and in-app token to credit conversion, among many other things.</p><p><strong>Noah's Ark</strong></p><p>One example of these DApps is Noah's Ark, which is touted as the first intelligent metaverse by Alethea AI on the AI Protocol. It allows for user-friendly interaction with the protocol, making it easy to create iNFTs. It also enables AI media generation, iNFT intelligence upgrades and access to AI services.</p><p>Noah's Ark has residents and visitors who are all actively engaging in the purchase and sale of various tokenized assets in secondary marketplaces. The Noah's Ark market aims to allow for better user experience, ease of discovery, and more contextual information about the tokenized assets within the Noah's Ark.

They are designed to alleviate the limitations of the Ethereum network, which include slow transaction processing times and high gas fees. Layer 2 solutions achieve these goals by moving some of the computational and transaction load off the Ethereum mainnet, while still maintaining a connection to it for security and trust.</p><p>Layer 2 solutions offload a significant portion of transaction processing from the Ethereum mainnet. This reduces congestion on Layer 1 and allows for faster and cheaper transactions. They use various techniques to bundle multiple transactions together and submit them to the mainnet as a single transaction or checkpoint.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/optimistic_rollups_explanation_c9da9bba24.jpg"" alt=""optimistic rollups explanation.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_optimistic_rollups_explanation_c9da9bba24.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_optimistic_rollups_explanation_c9da9bba24.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_optimistic_rollups_explanation_c9da9bba24.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_optimistic_rollups_explanation_c9da9bba24.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Optimistic Rollup Which BASE Uses, Explained by Arbitrum.

It provides a secure, cost-effective and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) which secure back to Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) blockchain. BASE was built on the open-source <a href=""https://stack.optimism.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">OP Stack</a> with the following features:</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li><strong>Secured by Ethereum:</strong> BASE is built on the security and scalability of Ethereum, leveraging Coinbase's expertise to facilitate onboarding from Coinbase, Ethereum L1 (the mainnet), and other interoperable chains. It benefits from Ethereum's security while offering additional features.</li><li><strong>Empowered by Coinbase:</strong> BASE offers easy integration with Coinbase's products, access to its user base and various developer tools. This enables developers to tap into the 110 million verified users and $80 billion+ assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Low Fee Transactions:</strong> BASE is designed to offer full <a href=""https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) compatibility at a lower cost. BASE supports cheaper transactions for DApps and provides developer APIs for account abstraction.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Open Source:</strong> BASE aims to be decentralized, permissionless and open to anyone interested in creating a standard, modular, rollup-agnostic <a href=""https://optimism.mirror.xyz/2jk3D1Y8-hid8YOCUUa6yXmsyzNCYYyFJP0Nhaey9x0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Superchain</a> powered by Optimism. It joins Optimism as a Core Dev on the open-source OP Stack and seeks to foster a thriving developer community.</li></ul><h2>How Does Base Work?</h2><p>As BASE is built using OP stack, it inherits all the benefits and technology of Optimistic roll-ups. Roll-ups are at the heart of the Layer 2 movement happening on Ethereum which radically reduces gas fees and transaction costs.&nbsp;</p><p>BASE employs Layer 2 technology to optimize cost-efficiency while retaining the full functionality of Ethereum. It does this by running a parallel blockchain network that operates on top of the primary Ethereum chain — hence the term “layer.” This Layer 2 network handles transaction processing for all participants within the BASE network. Subsequently, once these transactions are validated, they are transmitted to Ethereum Layer 1. The primary Ethereum blockchain then incorporates this data into its ledger, adding it to the main chain.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OP_L2_infographic_d1d6febe2a.png"" alt=""OP L2 infographic.png"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OP_L2_infographic_d1d6febe2a.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OP_L2_infographic_d1d6febe2a.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_OP_L2_infographic_d1d6febe2a.png 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>How an L2 Solution Works. Image via </i><a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-optimism-op"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><i>CoinGecko</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>BASE uses that ""<a href=""https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/optimistic-vs-zero-knowledge-rollups-what-s-the-difference"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rollup</a>"" mechanism, which essentially aggregates data from numerous distinct transactions into a single transaction bundle. By consolidating similar transactions, BASE further reduces the expenses associated with appending transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. In essence, BASE serves as a cost-efficient solution for Ethereum developers, where users and developers can make transactions much cheaper.</p><h2>Features of Coinbase BASE Protocol</h2><p>Coinbase BASE packs a punch. Let's explore!</p><h3>Security</h3><p>BASE inherits Ethereum's security by leveraging the power of Ethereum's Layer 1. When transactions are executed on BASE's Layer 2 scaling solution, they undergo a two-step process. First, they are swiftly processed off-chain, optimizing transaction speed and cost efficiency. However, the crucial security aspect comes into play during the second step when transaction data is periodically submitted to Ethereum's Layer 1 for verification.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that BASE relies on Ethereum's robust consensus mechanisms and battle-tested security protocols to ensure the integrity of transactions. Attempting to compromise or reverse a transaction on BASE would necessitate undermining the entire Ethereum network, an exceptionally challenging feat that effectively bolsters BASE's security and reinforces its trustworthiness for users and developers alike.</p><h3>Transaction Speeds and Capacities</h3><p>As BASE is built using OP stack, it inherits all the traits of Optimism’s optimistic rollups. In its current form, the max TPs achievable is 2,000 TPS according to <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum.org</a>. However, the introduction of data sharding on Ethereum is expected to improve scalability in optimistic rollups. Because roll-up transactions must share blockspace with other non-rollup transactions, their processing capacity is limited by data throughput on the main Ethereum chain. <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Danksharding</a> will increase the space available to L2 chains to publish data per block, using cheaper, impermanent ""blob"" storage instead of expensive, permanent CALLDATA.&nbsp;</p><p>Proto-danksharding, or <a href=""https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">EIP-4484</a>, is an intermediate step in the Danksharding journey which will further reduce gas costs and thus transaction fees on BASE and&nbsp;is expected to go live in Q4 2023.</p><h3>Integration with other platforms</h3><p>Because BASE is EVM-compatible, it’s very easy for developers to launch their platforms on BASE. Some of the biggest OG DeFi DApps such as <a href=""/review/aave-lend/"">AAVE</a>, <a href=""/review/sushiswap-sushi/"">SushiSwap</a>, <a href=""/review/curve-finance-crv/"">Curve Finance</a>, <a href=""/review/uniswap-uni/"">Uniswap</a> and <a href=""/review/compound-finance-comp/"">Compound</a> have already launched on BASE and boast high Total Value Locked (TVL). This demonstrates users' high confidence in a newly launched borderline experimental Layer 2.</p><h2>User Experience</h2><p>In Coinbase’s own words:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;“BASE is an easy way for decentralized apps to leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution. Seamless Coinbase integrations, easy fiat onramps, and access to the $130B assets on platform in the Coinbase ecosystem.” (Source: <a href=""https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/other/base"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Coinbase)</a></p></blockquote><p>In real terms of how this will benefit actual users in the future, I do imagine a scenario where users will be able to buy their assets from the Coinbase centralized exchange (CEX) and immediately withdraw to the BASE L2. From there, users will be able to use most of their favourite <a href=""/analysis/best-ethereum-dapps/"">Ethereum DApps</a> as well as some new and unique DApps at substantially lower cost than if they were using Ethereum Layer 1.</p><p>Essentially, new users will be using L2s, paying for fees in ETH at low rates and depositing their crypto to Coinbase to sell for fiat currencies without even realizing they are using Ethereum infrastructure and benefitting from Ethereum’s security. In much the same way that not many of us really understand how the internet works but we use it daily, I imagine a similar scenario with L2s and I believe Coinbase will facilitate this transition with ease as it’s already a huge and popular CEX.&nbsp;</p><h2>Advantages</h2><p>Coinbase's L2 solution, BASE, offers several to benefits the cryptocurrency ecosystem:</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li><strong>Cost-Efficient Transactions: </strong>BASE significantly reduces transaction costs compared to Ethereum's Layer 1. In fact, BASE claims it is 10 times cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet. This makes it more affordable for users to interact with blockchain applications, thereby increasing the overall accessibility of decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain services.</li><li><strong>Faster Transactions:</strong> Users on BASE can enjoy quicker transaction processing times. This improvement in speed enhances the user experience, especially for activities like trading, yield farming, and NFT transactions.</li><li><strong>Seamless Onboarding:</strong> Coinbase can directly onboard its 110 million verified users onto BASE without requiring them to bridge their assets from Ethereum L1. This eliminates a technical barrier for newcomers, making it easier for them to start using DeFi and DApps.</li><li><strong>User-Friendly Experience:</strong> Users won't necessarily need to understand the intricacies of Layer 2 technology. They can simply use Coinbase's platform and experience faster, cheaper transactions without the need for complex technical knowledge.</li><li><strong>Scalability for DeFi:</strong> The reduced fees and faster confirmation times on BASE can incentivize more users to participate in DeFi projects. This could lead to increased liquidity, improved yield opportunities, and a more robust DeFi ecosystem overall.</li><li><strong>Mainstream Adoption:</strong> By providing a more efficient and cost-effective user experience, BASE can help bridge the gap between cryptocurrency enthusiasts and mainstream users. This may encourage more people to explore and adopt blockchain technology.</li></ul><p>BASE aims to make cryptocurrency and blockchain technology more accessible, user-friendly, and cost-effective, ultimately benefiting both newcomers and seasoned crypto enthusiasts while contributing to the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><h2>BASE vs. Other Ethereum L2s</h2><p>Let’s compare BASE with some other popular blockchains as well as some ETH L2s using TVL and daily volume.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/defillama_BASE_2bf7a46715.png"" alt=""defillama BASE.png"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_defillama_BASE_2bf7a46715.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_defillama_BASE_2bf7a46715.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_defillama_BASE_2bf7a46715.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_defillama_BASE_2bf7a46715.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>BASE Stacks up Well Against Other Long-Established Blockchains Such as Solana or Cardano.

Just like other blockchains, you can use the Monero network to conduct transactions. However, the network is designed in a manner that hides transaction activity. To achieve this, Monero has a few tricks up its sleeves:</p><ul><li><strong>Ring signatures:</strong> This mixes real transactions with old decoy transactions to make it difficult to work out which transaction is legitimate.</li><li><strong>Stealth addresses:</strong> A one-time address that auto-generates numerous addresses for each transaction.</li><li><strong>RingCT: </strong>Also known as Ring Confidential Transactions, this feature mixes the amount sent so that the amount involved for each transaction cannot be easily tracked without the appropriate access.</li><li>On top of all this, a private ""<strong>view key</strong>"" is required to check the details of a transaction.</li></ul><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Ultimate_Monero_guide_f92ffb4081.jpg"" alt=""Monero guide.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Ultimate_Monero_guide_f92ffb4081.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Ultimate_Monero_guide_f92ffb4081.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Ultimate_Monero_guide_f92ffb4081.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Ultimate_Monero_guide_f92ffb4081.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Monero is a Privacy Coin that Hides Transactions Across its Network.

Zcash is still a privacy coin, but you can turn its privacy features off.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Monero_price_31515b3717.jpg"" alt=""Monero price.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Monero_price_31515b3717.jpg 196w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Monero_price_31515b3717.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Monero_price_31515b3717.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Monero XMR is the Largest Privacy Coin by Market Cap. Image via <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CoinGecko</a></figcaption></figure><p>With a <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">market cap</a> of $2.67 billion, Monero XMR is the largest privacy-focused token. Its circulating supply is over 18.1 million coins and its current price is close to $147. XMR reached an all-time high of $542.33 in January 2018. By comparison, the market capitalization for both Dash and Zcash is far lower than Monero — $302.9 million and $206.6 million, respectively.</p><p>The initial supply of Monero’s private cryptocurrency that could be mined was 18.4 million XMR. After this amount was reached, mining incentives came in the form of ""tail emissions,"" which are small rewards of XMR that are fed into the system every 60 seconds, keeping miners incentivized to continue validating the network. When tail emissions are taken into account, the maximum supply of XMR is infinite. By comparison, both Dash and Zcash have a finite supply.</p><h2>A Brief History of Monero</h2><p>Man, this is still straight out of a movie!</p><p>Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Bytecoin's July 2012 launch marked the first real-life implementation of CryptoNote. However, it was soon discovered that 80% of the coins had already been mined. The Bytecoin team came out with an explanation: The coin wasn't entirely new and had existed on the deep web for two years.</p><p>Needless to say, these claims weren't well received by the community, and some enthusiasts started to explore the CryptoNote protocol and concluded that the protocol itself was solid and innovative. The Bytecoin fork race was on!</p><p>In April 2014, the first Bytecoin fork, Bitmonero, was announced and a small community was formed which constituted the Monero core team at the time. However, something started to feel off. The founder, known only by an online alias, often disappeared for days at a time and tried to merge the new fork with Bytecoin against the community's wishes.</p><p>The founder eventually disappeared altogether, and Bitmonero went on to become the Monero project. Monero community members single-handedly saved it even though the Monero project may have had scammy beginnings.</p><p>We've covered all that and much, much more in our <a href=""/education/what-is-monero/"">in-depth Monero review</a>.</p><h2>How to Buy Monero XMR</h2><p>If you'd like to get your hands on some XMR coins, you can do so through reputable cryptocurrency exchanges such as <a href=""/review/binance/"">Binance</a>, <a href=""/review/kraken/"">Kraken</a> and <a href=""/review/coinbase-pro/"">Coinbase</a>, where you can also exchange Monero.</p><p>It's as simple as one, two, three!</p><ul><li><strong>Create your free account: </strong>You'll be asked to provide your name, email address and country of residence, and secure your account with a strong password.</li><li><strong>Connect your funding method:</strong> Once your account is verified, it's time for some financial information. You can link your credit/debit card to purchase XMR. You can also transfer fiat currencies from your bank account and then use that money to buy Monero.</li><li><strong>Buy Monero:</strong> And that's it! You can now purchase Monero. Just be sure to check payment details and fees before you purchase XMR.</li></ul><p>Head over to our <a href=""/review/best-crypto-exchanges/"">best crypto exchanges</a> list if you're having a tough time deciding which exchange to choose.</p><h2>How to Store Monero Safely: Top Monero Wallets</h2><p>To use Monero, you are going to need a wallet. These wallets are designed for users to securely and conveniently store XMR coins on the Monero blockchain.</p><p>The list below will provide top-level information, but if you'd like to get into the weeds, check out our full list of the <a href=""/analysis/best-monero-wallets/"">Top Monero Wallets</a>.</p><h3>Types of Monero wallets</h3><p>We're going to list our top Monero wallets across the three main categories: <a href=""/review/best-crypto-desktop-wallets/"">Desktop</a>, <a href=""/review/top-mobile-wallets/"">mobile</a> and <a href=""/analysis/best-hardware-wallets/"">hardware</a>. Here's a quick primer on each before we dive any further:</p><ul><li><strong>Desktop:</strong> These are installable software packs available for operating systems such as Windows, MacOS and Linux. If you're using this type of wallet, it's good to have anti-virus software on your system because Internet connectivity poses security vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Desktop wallets made for smartphones, these wallets often use QR codes for transactions. They may be suitable for daily operations, but they're also more susceptible to malware infection when compared to hardware wallets.</li><li><strong>Hardware:</strong> The most secure method of storing your cryptocurrencies at the cost of convenience. These are hardware devices that individually handle public addresses and keys. Unlike desktop and mobile wallets, which are mostly free, you'll have to pony up cash for hardware wallets.</li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let's get back to the best Monero wallets.</p><p><strong>Desktop</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Guarda Wallet:</strong> This wallet supports over 50 major blockchains and over 400,000 tokens. It is available and both a desktop and mobile wallet.</li><li><strong>Official Monero Desktop GUI:</strong> The official Monero desktop client is available for Windows, Mac, Linux and other operating systems. But this is a full-node wallet, which means you’ll have to wait for the wallet to download and synch with the full blockchain.</li></ul><p><strong>Mobile</strong></p><ul><li><strong>MyMonero:</strong> This wallet is managed by the same Monero core developer who created the Monero Ledger integration, and provides users with secure, hosted Monero accounts.</li><li><a href=""/review/monerujo-wallet/""><strong>Monerujo</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Monerujo runs as a light wallet, giving you the option of running your own node or of using remote nodes to synchronize your wallet with the Monero blockchain. Monerujo is completely open source. Bad news for iOS users, however, as this wallet is only available on Android.</li></ul><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ledger Nano:</strong> Ledger Nano was one of the first hardware wallets offering support for XMR. Ledger Nano comes in two versions: the <a href=""/review/ledger-nano-s-plus-review/"">Nano S Plus</a> for EUR79 and the <a href=""/review/ledger-nano-x/"">Nano X</a> for EUR149. The wallets allow you to manage over 5,500 coins and tokens.</li><li><strong>Trezor Model T:</strong> Costing $219, the <a href=""/review/trezor-model-t-review/"">Trezor Model T</a> is the only wallet in the Trezor lineup that supports XMR. Monero is supported on the Trezor Model T and can be used with third-party wallets including Monero GUI and Monero CLI.</li></ul><h3>Steps to Create a Monero Wallet</h3><p>Depending on which wallet you choose, the wallet creation process will look different. However, in a broader sense, each wallet has essentially the same pattern.</p><p>Here's what the process looks like for a software wallet:</p><ul><li><strong>Download the wallet:</strong> Most desktop wallets also offer apps for mobile devices. Once you have locked in on a wallet you like, download it to your desktop or phone.</li><li><strong>Backup the wallet:</strong> Be sure to create a backup of your wallet, we cover this step in our <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">crypto safety article</a>. You may also need to set up your assets of choice. Some wallets also have an identity verification process where you'll be asked to submit a selfie or a government ID.</li><li><strong>Transfer your assets:</strong> There are several ways you can go about this process, including depositing funds from a bank account, exchanging cryptocurrencies or receiving them from another wallet.</li></ul><p>For a hardware wallet, you can expect to jump through a few extra hoops.</p><ul><li><strong>Select your device:</strong> Security features and the manufacturer's reputation should be considered when you're in the market for a hardware wallet. Ledger, Trezor, <a href=""/review/ngrave-zero-hardware-wallet/"">NGRAVE</a> and <a href=""/review/bc-vault-review/"">BC Vault</a> are some of the most trusted hardware wallets.</li><li><strong>Install required software:</strong> Most wallets have a setup wizard that will guide you through the installation process. Once you've downloaded the software to either your phone or desktop, you can connect your hardware wallet using a USB cable or Bluetooth connection.</li><li><strong>Transfer your cryptocurrency:</strong> You will need to link your hardware wallet to a brokerage account or an exchange to transfer your assets. Once the crypto is transferred, it will be stored offline.</li></ul><h2>Sending and Receiving Transactions</h2><p>There are a few important things to know about sending and receiving confidential transactions on the Monero blockchain.</p><ul><li><strong>Irreversible transactions:</strong> Monero transactions are irreversible once they have been confirmed by a miner. Transferred money by mistake? If you know who owns the receiving address, the only way to get it back is to ask the receiver to send it back to you (we know how that will go).</li><li><strong>Monero transactions are private:</strong> Monero employs privacy-enhancing technologies to hide details of a transaction, such as the sender's address, amount and the recipient's address. Even the payment recipient wouldn't know the sender's wallet address.</li><li><strong>Sender pays the fees:</strong> In Monero, the payment sender will be on the hook for any transaction fee.</li><li><strong>Transaction fees are not dependent on the amount:</strong> Instead, the fee depends on the network congestion at the time and the data size of your transaction, which increases together with the number of recipients and coins being spent.</li></ul><p>Right, let's now explore how to send and receive transactions on the Monero network.</p><h3>Creating a transaction</h3><p>In order to send a transaction, your node and wallet must be synchronized and the currently selected account must have an available unlocked balance. Next, enter the recipient's address (a Monero address starts with a 4 or an 8). Then, it's just a matter of entering the amount in XMR (conversion in USD or EUR should be visible). You can also conduct multiple transactions.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Monero_transaction_555de9ac6a.jpg"" alt=""Monero transaction.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Monero_transaction_555de9ac6a.jpg 196w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Monero_transaction_555de9ac6a.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>An Image by Monero on How to Make a Payment. Image via Monero</figcaption></figure><p>It's important to note that a transaction with multiple recipients will only pay a single transaction fee. However, more recipients means you'll be charged a higher fee.</p><p>The transaction fee does not depend on the amount sent, it depends on the network congestion at the time and the data size of your transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the level of privacy that Monero allows, people cannot just see a public record of payments you've sent. To validate transactions, you need to have a record of something called a ""TXKEY,"" which is only stored against a local copy of your Monero wallet. If you have created multiple wallets for the same address, then you cannot use any other wallet to obtain the TXKEY that you will require to prove payment.</p><h3>Receiving funds</h3><p>When someone sends Monero to you, the Monero network will include that transaction in a Monero block, a record of a batch of confidential transactions that have been announced to the Monero network of nodes. Each block takes on average two minutes to mine by the network. The successful mining of each block results in a confirmation.</p><p>To receive XMR, you only need to provide the payer with an address to which they can send funds. Most of the time, it's easier to just share a QR code and let the payer scan it, instead of copy-pasting the alphanumeric string. With the GUI, every generated address comes with its QR code.</p><p>The sender can scan the QR code with the Monero wallet on their phone and the recipient will receive their XMR in minutes. Remember you can generate as many addresses (subaddresses) as you want. This is useful if you want to keep funds separated for any reason.</p><h2>Monero Privacy Features</h2><p>By now, you're aware that Monero takes a privacy-centric approach to blockchain transactions, cloaking the movement of funds across its network.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Monero_privacy_features_56bdc50390.jpg"" alt=""Monero privacy features.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Monero_privacy_features_56bdc50390.jpg 208w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Monero_privacy_features_56bdc50390.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Monero_privacy_features_56bdc50390.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Monero_privacy_features_56bdc50390.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Monero Utilizes 3 Privacy-Enhancing Technologies to Hide Transactions. Infographic Created via Canva</figcaption></figure><p>Let's explore all three in detail.</p><h3>Ring Signatures</h3><p>Ring Signatures make it difficult to identify the sender and recipient in a transaction.</p><p>In cryptography, a ring signature is a type of digital signature that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. At Monero, a ring signature uses your account keys and a number of public keys pulled from the blockchain.</p><p>In a ""ring"" of possible signers, all ring members are equal and valid. This means an outside observer can't tell which of the possible signers in a signature group belongs to your account. As a result, ring signatures ensure that transaction outputs are untraceable.</p><h3>Stealth Addresses</h3><p>Stealth addresses create random one-time addresses for every transaction on behalf of the recipient. The recipient can publish just one address, yet have all of their incoming payments go to unique addresses on the blockchain, where they cannot be linked back to either the recipient's published address or any other transactions' addresses.</p><p>Stealth addresses allow only the sender and the receiver to know where a payment was sent.</p><h3>Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)</h3><p>This deals with how transaction amounts are hidden in Monero. Ring CT was implemented in January 2017 and became mandatory for all transactions on the network after September 2017.</p><p>RingCT introduced an improved version of ring signatures called ""A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature"", which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions.</p><h2>Monero vs. Other Cryptocurrencies</h2><p>Bitcoin is the first and the most famous of all cryptocurrencies today. It is highly liquid and transaction history on the network is available to the general public. Monero, on the other hand, offers something the Bitcoin blockchain lacks: privacy and anonymity.</p><p>Here's a handy table that outlines the main differences between Monero and Bitcoin.</p><figure class=""table""><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Bitcoin</th><th>Monero</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Pseudonymous, not anonymous</td><td>Hides the sender, receiver, and amount of every transaction</td></tr><tr><td>Supply</td><td>Limited supply</td><td>Infinite supply due to “<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/with-90-percent-of-monero-mined-attention-turns-to-tail-emission-from-2022"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tail Emissions</a>”</td></tr><tr><td>Mining</td><td>Requires special hardware</td><td>Can be mined with home computers</td></tr><tr><td>Block size</td><td>Limited</td><td>Adaptive</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction speed</td><td>About 10 minutes</td><td>About 20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency of forks</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Monero Mining: How to Mine XMR</h2><p>Bitcoin brought the term ""crypto mining"" into the lexicon, but requires specialized hardware and dedicated mining farms have sprung up, leading to mining centralization. Monero's Cryptonote RandomX mining algorithm is resistant to this type of hardware and as such, keeps the mining decentralized.</p><p>Every transaction requires a miner to validate a transaction, and when miners complete this task they earn block rewards in the form of Monero XMR tokens.</p><p>There are two ways you can go about mining XMR coins:</p><ul><li>DIY</li><li>Monero mining pools</li></ul><p>Check out our dedicated guide to <a href=""/mining/monero-home/"">Monero Mining</a> if you would like to learn the ins and outs of Monero mining.&nbsp;</p><h3>DIY</h3><p>A proof of work consensus mechanism requires miners to validate transactions. Miners set up computer GPUs and CPUs, along with Monero mining software, which works to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. However, taking the DIY approach is basically like playing the lottery — your odds of being a successful solo miner are considerably low.&nbsp;</p><p>Miners receive <a href=""https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/tail-emission.html "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">0.6 XMR</a> for every block that gets added to the Monero blockchain. According to one estimate, Monero mining can fetch <a href=""https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/monero/calculator"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">$1 per day</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mining pool</h3><p>Solo mining lacks the hash power needed to adequately compete with the larger mining pools. As a result, many people choose to join a mining pool. Sure, this will result in fewer rewards per miner, but there's a high chance of successfully mining blocks, which translates into regular rewards.</p><p>We also have a guide to finding the <a href=""/mining/best-monero-pools/"">best Monero mining pools</a> if you choose this route.</p><p><a href=""https://hub.coinbureau.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg"" alt=""Join-The-CoinBureau-Club-Inline-Banner.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Join_The_Coin_Bureau_Club_Inline_Banner_494b0ce69b.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Tips for Secure Monero Transactions</h2><p>With great power comes great responsibility! This is especially true for Monero, where transactions aren't public information and the only way to reverse one is to ask the other party to send it back, presuming you even know who you sent them to.</p><p>Here are a few tips to keep you safe on the Monero adventure trails.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep your software updated:</strong> ""Ugh, not again,"" I groan as I'm notified of a pending system update. Software updates may look like a minor inconvenience, but these security updates serve to patch any vulnerabilities before they are discovered by hackers.</li><li><strong>Invest in a hardware wallet:</strong> Hardware wallets provide the most bang for your buck when it comes to storing your Monero. A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys. Come transaction time, you can sign with a single click.</li><li><strong>Verify the recipient's address:</strong> Crypto wallet addresses are a complicated set of mumbo jumbo. To ensure accuracy, it's best to always copy/paste the address AND manually check the entire address because keyboard-hacking software is a thing now.</li><li><strong>Test small:</strong> Before you conduct a transaction, it's advisable to do a small test run to ensure everything is working A-OK. Instead of the whole amount, you can send a small amount of Monero as a test transaction.</li></ul><h2>Master Guide to Monero: Conclusion</h2><p>And, there you have it folks! This ultimate Monero guide has provided insights into creating a Monero wallet, buying XMR, sending and receiving transactions, and mining XMR. It also highlighted the importance of privacy and security in Monero transactions, emphasizing the use of hardware wallets, verifying recipient addresses, and conducting small test transactions to ensure smooth operations.</p><p>Monero distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, by offering true privacy. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and transparent, Monero ensures that all transaction details remain confidential. Moreover, Monero's dynamic block size, ASIC-resistant mining algorithm, and continuous tail emissions contribute to a decentralized and accessible mining network.</p><p>In a world where data breaches and surveillance are prevalent concerns, Monero remains a go-to option for individuals seeking financial privacy and transactional anonymity.</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Education/how-to-use-ethereum/,How to Use Ethereum: Surfing Ethereum Transactions,Education,https://www.coinbureau.com/Analysis/cardano-use-cases/,Cardano Use Cases: How ADA is Shaping the Future,Analysis,https://www.coinbureau.com/Education/dappos/,dappOS: The Intent-Centric Operating Protocol,Education,https://www.coinbureau.com/Press Release/token2049-sets-record/,"TOKEN2049- Sets Record With Over 10,000 Attendees",Press Release,"<p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>With Over 10,000 Attendees Confirmed, TOKEN2049 Singapore Sets Record-Breaking</strong></p><p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Attendee and Sponsor Numbers Amid All-Star Speaker Line-Up</strong></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">● <i>World’s largest Web3 event hits full capacity with over 10,000+ attendees globally, 300+ exhibitors and 400+</i></p><p style=""text-align:center;""><i>side events; making it the industry’s biggest international gathering of the year</i></p><p style=""text-align:center;""><i>● Speakers include Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao; prolific entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan; F1 Driver Daniel</i></p><p style=""text-align:center;""><i>Ricciardo; Worldcoin Co-Founder and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and many more</i></p><p><strong>SINGAPORE — 8 September 2023 — </strong><a href=""https://www.asia.token2049.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TOKEN2049</a>, Asia’s premier Web3 and crypto conference, confirms a record-breaking 10,000+ attendees and over 300 exhibitors ahead of its upcoming Singapore edition, with over 400+ side events taking place as part of <a href=""https://week.token2049.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TOKEN2049 Week</a>.

In a post on Medium, Fazel describes how his experience in the world of traditional finance armed him with the knowledge that helped bring SwissBorg into existence.</p><blockquote><p>“Blockchain would enable us to have the maximum reach and accessibility we required where Tokens would enable us to create any tailor-made investment mandate with no cost and intermediaries. And on top of this, we could leverage a strong community with decentralization based on a trusted meritocratic system.” (<a href=""https://medium.com/swissborg/meet-cyrus-fazel-swissborg-ceo-db07bbf50e90"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>SwissBorg aims to give individuals complete control over their portfolios and investments. Today, the company sits at the crossroads of blockchain technology and personal finance.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Swiss_Borg_values_d359c53832.jpg"" alt=""SwissBorg values.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Swiss_Borg_values_d359c53832.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Swiss_Borg_values_d359c53832.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Swiss_Borg_values_d359c53832.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Swiss_Borg_values_d359c53832.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Transparency, Equality Through Aeritocracy and Impartiality Are Among SwissBorg's Values. Image via SwissBorg</figcaption></figure><p>From its Auto-Invest feature to the more recent Thematics offerings, SwissBorg has transformed into a powerful crypto investment solution aimed at generating wealth.</p><h3>Products and Services</h3><p>Here are some of the key features of SwissBorg:</p><ul><li><strong>Wealth management:</strong> SwissBorg's wealth management app allows users to track and manage their crypto portfolios.</li><li><strong>Smart Engine:</strong> The brains behind the SwissBorg app! As you’re aware, market volatility often leads to price differences across exchanges. Smart Engine allows users to exchange between different fiat and crypto assets in the app. It scours multiple exchanges to ensure you get the best price.</li><li><strong>Native token:</strong> CHSB is SwissBorg’s native token that’s built on Ethereum. It gives holders voting rights to steer SwissBorg’s direction, unlocks higher loyalty tier benefits, and can be staked.</li><li><strong>SwissBorg Earn:</strong> This allows you to earn daily yield through staking or DeFi exposure. Depending on the asset you choose, you will have multiple strategies available: A conservative strategy with lower yields or a more aggressive strategy with higher returns. All profits earned are reinvested, which will compound your returns over time.</li><li><strong>Auto-Invest:</strong> Put investing on autopilot! This feature uses Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), a popular strategy among investors, to reduce volatility by investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. You can auto-invest from any supported fiat or cryptocurrency to any cryptocurrency or Thematics, and you have full control over how much and how often you’d like to contribute.</li><li><strong>Asset analysis:</strong> Thanks to artificial intelligence, you can view full asset analysis for all cryptos available in the SwissBorg app. This is made achievable through CyBorg Predictor — which forecasts an asset's movement over the next 24 hours — and SwissBorg Indicator — which does technical analysis trend prediction. Community sentiment is also taken into account.</li><li><strong>Portfolio visualizer:</strong> This free tool provides in-depth investment analysis and statistics in an easy-to-understand format.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>SwissBorg Security</h3><p>Losing the private keys to your crypto wallet is a nightmare scenario. To address this, SwissBorg partnered with Fireblocks, which helps financial institutions protect digital assets from theft or hackers by using multi-party computation (MPC) and patent-pending chip isolation technology to secure private keys and API credentials.</p><p>MPC is the ability for multiple parties to jointly perform mathematical computations without one party ever revealing its secret to others. Fireblocks combines MPC-CMP with hardware isolation to create a multi-layer security technology. This eliminates a single point of failure and insulates digital assets from cyber-attacks, internal collusion, and human error.</p><h2>Thematics Overview</h2><p>SwissBorg offers multiple products that look to help crypto investors manage their wealth and offers a plethora of crypto investment avenues. Its Thematics offering is a pretty unique and innovative investment product in the industry.</p><h3>Concept and Rationale</h3><p>Crypto investment products are all the rage these days, and the top among those are exchange-traded funds. However, some of these ETFs don’t give you exposure to the full flavour of the industry. For example, <a href=""https://etfs.ark-funds.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ETF_Website/Fact_Sheets/ARKW_Factssheet.pdf "" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ARK Next Generation Internet ETF</a>'s top-10 holdings do not include any individual crypto tokens. In fact, you’ll find names like car maker Tesla, e-commerce platform Shopify and games company Roblox. The only crypto-related exposure it has is through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which rounds out the ETF's top 3 holdings.</p><p>This is where SwissBorg Thematics differs. Instead of doing away with crypto altogether, it exposes you directly to various tokens. It's important to note that Thematics are not ETFs.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Swiss_Borg_Thematics_homepage_2695bd3930.jpg"" alt=""SwissBorg Thematics homepage.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_homepage_2695bd3930.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_homepage_2695bd3930.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_homepage_2695bd3930.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_homepage_2695bd3930.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Thematics is SwissBorg's Most Advanced Investment Product To Date.

Image via SwissBorg</figcaption></figure><p>Here are a few of its features and functions:</p><ul><li><strong>Quick diversification:</strong> Instead of you having to select cryptos to diversify your portfolio, SwissBorg’s analysts will automate this process for you by picking the best crypto assets, taking into account various factors such as common theme, token performance and tokenomics, among other relevant criteria.</li><li><strong>Quality management: </strong>The SwissBorg team ensures quality management of the Thematics content. This is achieved by keeping the ratio of each token as close to the target as possible, while conducting extensive research to keep Thematics up-to-date, despite market conditions and other risks.</li><li><strong>Rebalancing:</strong> Each thematic crypto asset has an algorithmically optimized target percentage to minimize risks and maximize value. Rebalancing typically occurs every 30 days and depends on when you bought your first Thematic, regardless of any top-ups.</li><li><strong>Reallocation:</strong> SwissBorg always keeps an eye out for new market opportunities and low-performing crypto assets. The tokens and their allocation are changed every 70 days to ensure the Thematic stays true to its theme and performs at its desired level.</li></ul><p>In addition to these, SwissBorg is also looking to roll out a new feature later that will let you earn rewards based on your Thematic balance. These rewards will be paid out on a weekly basis in CHSB, its native token.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/How_to_buy_Thematic_image_f8fb538d3a.jpg"" alt=""How to buy Thematic image.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_How_to_buy_Thematic_image_f8fb538d3a.jpg 193w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_How_to_buy_Thematic_image_f8fb538d3a.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Buying a Thematic That Appeals to You Is Just a Few Clicks Away.

One thing we appreciate about SwissBorg is their dedication to transparency.</p><p>Its last performance update for the Web3 Thematic was in March 2023, and the company hasn't provided performance data for the newer Golden Thematics.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Web3_Thematic_performance_c472d7b996.jpg"" alt=""Web3 Thematic performance.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Web3_Thematic_performance_c472d7b996.jpg 152w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Web3_Thematic_performance_c472d7b996.jpg 488w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Web3_Thematic_performance_c472d7b996.jpg 731w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Web3 Thematic Was in the Red in March 2023.

Overall, the Web3 Thematic was down 5.3%. CHSB, SwissBorg's native token, was among the worst performers.&nbsp;</p><p>Turning to fees, SwissBorg recently lowered the fees it charges for Thematics. Before we dive into that, however, let's first explore the company's plans because the fees depend on what tier you're on.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Swiss_Borg_Plans_63422b86d4.jpg"" alt=""SwissBorg Plans.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Swiss_Borg_Plans_63422b86d4.jpg 241w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Swiss_Borg_Plans_63422b86d4.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Swiss_Borg_Plans_63422b86d4.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>The More CHSB Tokens You're Willing to Lock Away, the More You Can Get Out of SwissBorg.

Of course, the more you do, the more you can get out of the SwissBorg platform. That means a higher earn boost, and lower exchange and auto-invest fees.</p><p>This mantra also extends to Thematics. Standard, Explorer, Community and Pioneer are charged a monthly subscription of 0.25%, while Generation and Genesis members pay 0.20% per month.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Swiss_Borg_Thematics_fees_078848a42b.jpg"" alt=""SwissBorg Thematics fees.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_fees_078848a42b.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_fees_078848a42b.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Swiss_Borg_Thematics_fees_078848a42b.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>The New and Improved SwissBorg Thematics Fee Structure.

Web3 is the next iteration of the internet, one that’s open, independent and accessible. SwissBorg is betting that as Web3 picks up, so will crypto adoption as it’ll become the currency of the new web.</p><p>Here is a look at the basket of tokens that makes up the Web3 Thematic:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Web3_Thematic_portfolio_ad7d91fbde.jpg"" alt=""Web3 Thematic portfolio.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Web3_Thematic_portfolio_ad7d91fbde.jpg 172w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Web3_Thematic_portfolio_ad7d91fbde.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Web3_Thematic_portfolio_ad7d91fbde.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Web3 Thematic Gives You Exposure to Many Cryptocurrencies. Image via SwissBorg</figcaption></figure><p>The Web3 Thematic is spread among 13 tokens. <a href=""/review/cosmos-atom/"">Cosmos</a> (ATOM), <a href=""/education/what-is-ethereum/"">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a href=""/review/polkadot-dot/"">Polkadot</a> (DOT), <a href=""/education/polygon-2023-beginners-guide-to-matic/"">Polygon</a> (MATIC), <a href=""/review/secret-network-scrt/"">Secret</a> (SCRT) and SwissBorg's native CHSB token each have a 10% target ratio. Interestingly, <a href=""/education/what-is-bitcoin/"">Bitcoin</a> isn’t included in the list.</p><h3>Golden Thematic</h3><p>The Golden Thematic capitalizes on Bitcoin's growth potential during market upswings and switches to <a href=""/analysis/bitcoin-vs-gold-inflation-hedge/"">gold</a> during a bear run or downside volatility in a fully automated manner.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Golden_Thematic_95b8bf2d05.jpg"" alt=""Golden Thematic.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Golden_Thematic_95b8bf2d05.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Golden_Thematic_95b8bf2d05.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Golden_Thematic_95b8bf2d05.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Golden Thematics Gives You Exposure to Bitcoin and Gold. Image via SwissBorg</figcaption></figure><p>The Golden Thematic provides access to Gold through Tether Gold (XAUT), a digital token backed by physical gold. Each XAUT token represents 1 troy ounce of gold held in a physical vault. As of March 30, Tether's <a href=""https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/24G4DuQ0HE7h7EQE6vGy4J/8a8a170edf687ea07b3f86048af8b87b/ESO.03.01_Std_ISAE_3000R_Opinion_31-03-2023_BDO_Tether_CRR.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gold reserves</a> totalled $3.4 billion. By comparison, XAUT's market cap is $470.2 million, according to <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether-gold"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CoinGecko</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>During different market regimes such as bull, correcting, bear, or accumulating markets, the SwissBorg algorithm adjusts the investment allocations to optimize returns. The reallocations are subject to predefined limits. Unlike the Web3 Thematic, which follows a recurrent schedule and a monthly rebalancing, the Golden Thematic does not have a recurring queue. Instead, you are placed in a random queue upon a new signal, and the SissBorg Smart Engine executes reallocations.</p><p>This is an interesting investing concept as the Golden Thematic looks to capitalize on Bitcoin's upward price movements when they happen and then retreats to the safety of gold to protect against drops in Bitcoin's price.</p><h3>Future Thematics</h3><p>In a YouTube video, SwissBorg laid out options for other such investment products. Before we dive into that, however, I'd like to direct your attention to SwissBorg's native CHSB token.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/CHSB_breakdown_bcab227537.jpg"" alt=""CHSB breakdown.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_CHSB_breakdown_bcab227537.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_CHSB_breakdown_bcab227537.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_CHSB_breakdown_bcab227537.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_CHSB_breakdown_bcab227537.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>The CHSB Utility Token Underpins the SwissBorg Ecosystem.

The hallmarks of the best crypto wallets include:</p><ul><li><strong>Private keys:</strong> Wallets that put you in the driver's seat. On the flip side, you're responsible for any loss of funds or mismanagement of keys that may incur.</li><li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> A user interface that's easy on the eyes and a breeze to navigate.</li><li><strong>Development community:</strong> An active development community means better support, frequent updates, and the quick patching of any security vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Backup and recovery:</strong> Being able to set up backup and restore features. This typically involves writing down a seed phrase and keeping it somewhere secure.</li><li><strong>Reputation:</strong> A wallet's reputation is an important thing to consider. You can read reviews online to get a sense of the wallet's track record.</li></ul><p>With Ethereum wallets, however, you'll need something that does more.</p><ul><li>Wallets that provide a gateway to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized exchanges (DExes)</li><li>The ability to <a href=""/guides/how-to-stake-ethereum/"">stake your ETH</a></li><li><a href=""/adoption/how-safe-is-decentralized-finance/"">DeFi</a> capabilities</li><li>NFT support</li></ul><p>For more on protecting your digital tokens, check out our <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">crypto safety guide</a>.</p><h2>Top 10 Ethereum Wallets</h2><p>The type of wallet you choose determines its specific features and the level of security it provides.

But the top-10 DApps on Ethereum are mostly DeFi, which serves as an alternative to the current financial system.</p><p>If you're in the market for a long-term solution, Trezor, BC Vault, Ledger and ELLIPAL would be good choices as they're hardware wallets, resulting in a <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">higher level of security than software wallets</a>. These wallets securely keep your private keys in cold storage, meaning they are not connected to the internet. So, if you aren't looking to cash out on that crypto nest egg anytime soon, this would be the way to go.</p><p>With regards to DeFi specifically, MetaMask is an accessible entry point to connect to the world of DeFi. It lets you swap crypto, utilizing data from decentralized exchanges and market makers to ensure you get the best prices. Looking to earn yield on your crypto? MetaMask lets you stake ETH and MATIC.</p><p>If convenience is your thing, Wallet Connect's integration with Trust Wallet and other wallets brings a host of quality-of-life improvements for DeFi. You can subscribe to push notifications directly from your favourite DApps.</p><p><a href=""https://guy.coinbureau.com/signup/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg"" alt=""Newsletter Inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Ethereum Staking Support</h2><p>There aren't a whole lot of wallets offering Ethereum staking support.

In fact, the five largest companies — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Nvidia and Alphabet — are all IT firms. Healthcare makes up 13.1% and financial companies round out the top three with a 12.6% share of the index.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 traces its roots to 1923 when <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/Standard-and-Poors"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Standard and Poor’s</a> introduced an index covering 233 companies weekly. The index, in its current form, was created in 1957 and would go on to become the most widely used proxy of the U.S. stock market. The index is maintained by a group of S&amp;P’s economists and index analysts.</p><h3>Why is the S&amp;P 500 so Important?</h3><p>The S&amp;P 500 is a stalwart index representing the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. It stands as a cornerstone of the conventional investment market and is renowned for its stability and historical significance.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/S_and_P_500_returns_over_20_years_4c034452f6.jpg"" alt=""S&amp;P 500 returns over 20 years"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_S_and_P_500_returns_over_20_years_4c034452f6.jpg 244w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_S_and_P_500_returns_over_20_years_4c034452f6.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_S_and_P_500_returns_over_20_years_4c034452f6.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>The S&amp;P 500 Has Posted More Gains Than Losses in the Last 20 Years.

But the S&amp;P 500 is the most widely followed index. As a result, it's performance is used to determine investors’ perception of current and future economic conditions.</li><li><strong>Global impact:</strong> As the U.S. is the largest economy in the world, its markets' influence extends beyond its borders. Indeed, U.S. equity markets <a href=""https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/research-quarterly-equities/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20equity%20markets%20are,the%20next%20largest%20market%2C%20China."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">represent</a> 42.5% of the global equity market cap. As a result, the S&amp;P 500's performance on any day impacts global financial markets from Asia to Europe. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Market cap weighting:</strong> This means that companies with larger market values have a proportionally greater impact on the index's performance. This approach to market capitalization weighting reflects the size and influence of different companies within the economy.</li><li><strong>Historical data:</strong> The index in its current form came into existence more than 65 years ago. It provides a treasure trove of data to help anyone analyze market trends, economic cycles and the effects of market-moving events.</li></ul><h2>S&amp;P 500 Historical Performance</h2><p>Between 1965 and 2022, the S&amp;P 500 returned an average of <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-stock-market-return#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20stock%20market,return%20in%202022%20was%2018.1%25."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">9.9%</a>. Its highest return was in 1995, just before the dot-com bubble, when the index returned 34.11%. In 2008, when the housing market crisis was in full swing, the S&amp;P 500 was down 38.49%. For most traditional investors, a 9.9% average return isn’t too shabby at all.</p><p>Overall, the index has returned a profit more times than it has turned red.</p><p>Most crypto investors would scoff at these returns. After all, investors in the crypto sphere can blow past these returns with their eyes closed. <a href=""/review/axie-infinity/"">Axie Infinity</a>, then a small-cap altcoin, rewarded investors with a mind-boggling 71,910.71% return in a single year.

The S&amp;P 500, a revered index tracing the growth of the largest U.S. companies, stands as a testament to the enduring strength of established markets, with its historical returns and pivotal role in assessing economic health.</p><p>Contrastingly, the realm of cryptocurrencies has stormed onto the financial stage, offering breathtaking returns and embodying a paradigm shift in investment ideologies. In this digital arena, crypto tokens have achieved meteoric rises (and losses), outpacing the traditional market indices by margins that appear surreal. The volatile nature of the crypto landscape, while presenting risks, has also demonstrated its resilience to macroeconomic turmoil for the most part.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global financial landscape evolves and adapts to new challenges, both the S&amp;P 500 and cryptocurrencies continue to shape investor strategies. The former, grounded in historical significance and offering steady growth, remains a foundation for many portfolios. The latter, with its explosive returns and transformative potential, is intriguing for risk-tolerant investors seeking to capitalize on innovation and disruption.</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Review/phantom-wallet-review/,Phantom Wallet Review: Top Solana Wallet Pros and Cons,Review,"<blockquote><p>""The crypto wallet that’ll take you places.""</p></blockquote><p>That's what Phantom Wallet proclaims on its website.

Let's take a deep dive!</p><p><strong>Phantom Wallet Review: Summary</strong></p><blockquote><p>Initially renowned as a Solana-based digital asset wallet, Phantom Wallet has since branched out to include <a href=""/education/what-is-ethereum/"">Ethereum</a> and <a href=""/education/polygon-2023-beginners-guide-to-matic/"">Polygon</a> networks as well. At its core, Phantom Wallet aims to be a hassle-free way to make make managing your private keys for DeFi projects easy.</p><p>It is a decentralized Web3 self-custodial browser extension and wallet that works with some of the most famous browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Brave and Edge. It can be accessed through your iOS or Android mobile device as well. You can use the wallet to collect NFTs, send and receive cryptocurrencies and tokens, and swap tokens.</p></blockquote><p>If you are interested in Guy's take on the Phantom Wallet, feel free to check out his beginner's guide below:</p><figure class=""media""><div data-oembed-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI-Xd9vVnwY""><div style=""position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zI-Xd9vVnwY"" style=""position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></div></div></figure><p><strong>The Key Features of Phantom Wallet are:</strong></p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li><strong>Solana staking:</strong> Users who hold SOL tokens can participate in the Solana network and earn rewards by delegating their tokens to stake with one of the hundreds of validators who run, maintain and secure the blockchain. A smaller validator with a higher APY and lower commission is best for the Solana ecosystem and your returns, according to the company. Phantom Wallet recommends <a href=""https://www.validators.app/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">validators.app</a> or <a href=""https://stakeview.app/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">StakeView.app</a> to find a ranked list of the best options.</li><li><strong>Token swap:</strong> Phantom Wallet allows you to conduct in-app swaps for Ethereum, Polygon and Solana networks. It charges a flat 0.85% fee for searching and offering the best pricing available for most swaps. This fee is on top of <a href=""/education/complete-guide-to-crypto-network-fees/"">network fees.</a></li><li><strong>NFTs and collectables storage:</strong> Non-fungible tokens may not be hot right now, but Phantom Wallet makes storing them easy. A feature lets you group similar NFTs together, saving you precious time of having to sift through hundreds of them to find what you're looking for. You can hide and remove unwanted spam, discover new collections, and manage listings all from within your wallet. Users also have access to metadata like floor price, last sale price, total return and total unique holders.</li><li><strong>Multichain support:</strong> Phantom Wallet may have started with support for just the Solana ecosystem, but it has since added Ethereum and Polygon to the list of supported networks. You can import your existing <a href=""/education/metamask-beginners-guide/"">MetaMask</a>, <a href=""/review/solana-sol/"">Solana</a> or EVM wallets to Phantom. You can view all your tokens and NFTs in one place and connect to apps automatically.</li><li><strong>Ledger integration</strong>: If you have a <a href=""/review/ledger-nano-x/"">Ledger hardware wallet</a>, you can use it for Solana, Ethereum and Polygon through Phantom Wallet. However, if you're looking to integrate Ledger with Phantom, it can only be achieved via Chrome, Brave or Microsoft Edge; Firefox isn't currently supported. Phantom mobile apps currently don't support Ledger hardware wallets either, but the company plans to add this feature soon.</li><li><strong>Non-custodial:</strong> Phantom Wallet puts you in the driver's seat, which means users can control their assets completely without any intrusion from a third party. In a non-custodial wallet, users have full control of their wallet. On the flip side, if you lose your seed phrase, the account cannot be recovered.</li></ul><p><a href=""/deals/trading/swissborg/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Swissborg_inline_57564f04fd.jpg"" alt=""Swissborg inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Swissborg_inline_57564f04fd.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Swissborg_inline_57564f04fd.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Swissborg_inline_57564f04fd.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Phantom Wallet Overview</h2><figure class=""table""><table><tbody><tr><td>Type of wallet</td><td>Software (browser extension support for Chrome, Brave, Firefox and Edge)</td></tr><tr><td>Released</td><td>2021</td></tr><tr><td>Supported networks</td><td>Solana, Ethereum and Polygon</td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td><td>Free to download</td></tr><tr><td>Staking</td><td>Yes, Solana tokens only</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile app</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>NFT support</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction or balance limits</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>What is Phantom Wallet?</h2><p>Phantom is a non-custodial multichain <a href=""/adoption/what-is-web-3-0/"">Web3</a> wallet with support for Solana, Ethereum and Polygon networks.

As it currently stands, in-app swaps are available for EVM chains. Phantom has a built-in swapper system, which aggregates liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges or DEXes.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Phantom_Wallet_Token_Swaps_11c087c7c6.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet Token Swaps.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Phantom_Wallet_Token_Swaps_11c087c7c6.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Phantom_Wallet_Token_Swaps_11c087c7c6.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Phantom_Wallet_Token_Swaps_11c087c7c6.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Phantom_Wallet_Token_Swaps_11c087c7c6.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>A Look at Swapping Tokens in the Phantom Wallet. Image via <a href=""https://twitter.com/phantom/status/1389298960989257729"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter.com/phantom</a></figcaption></figure><p>Phantom charges a flat 0.85% fee on token swaps in addition to network fees. It also uses the default setting of slippage limited to 0.5%. As is the case with swaps, it's important that you have enough of the network's native token for transaction costs (ETH tokens on Ethereum, Matic on Polygon and SOL on Solana). An insufficient native token balance will cause a swap fail to occur. You can learn more about network fees and transaction costs in our <a href=""/education/complete-guide-to-crypto-network-fees/"">Guide to Network Fees.</a></p><h3>Crypto Staking in Phantom Wallet</h3><p>Cryptocurrency staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to participate in the network's operations and earn rewards in return for locking up their coins as collateral. Phantom currently only supports Solana tokens for this purpose. The company recommends checking validators.app or StakeView.app to find a ranked list of the best options based on current network conditions.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Staking_363b3e9958.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet Staking"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Staking_363b3e9958.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Staking_363b3e9958.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Phantom Wallet currently only lets users stake SOL.

Phantom recommends choosing a smaller validator with a higher APY and lower commission. You can check your Solana staking rewards in the Phantom app. These rewards cannot be withdrawn unless you unstake your SOL. Instead, rewards are compounded and you earn more SOL.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Staking2_d48ae631b5.jpg"" alt=""Solana Staking Rewards"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Staking2_d48ae631b5.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Staking2_d48ae631b5.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>APY for Solana staking can currently fetch APY of as high as 9%.

Otherwise, your transaction will fail to go through.</p><h3>Phantom Wallet NFT Support</h3><p>Phantom lets you connect to several NFT marketplaces. You can sell your NFTs and immediately get funds using the ""Instant Sell"" feature.</p><p>Here's how that works: Phantom aggregates offers from the top marketplaces to get you the best possible price. It's then served to you directly within your NFT. If you have an offer, you'll see an ""Instant Sell"" banner with a ""sell now” price listed, which is your NFT's highest available bid.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/NF_Ts_82995e1f4d.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet NFTs"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_NF_Ts_82995e1f4d.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_NF_Ts_82995e1f4d.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_NF_Ts_82995e1f4d.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_NF_Ts_82995e1f4d.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Phantom lets you connect to several NFT marketplaces.

The company currently gathers bids from Solana and EVM marketplaces like OpenSea, Blur, LooksRare, X2Y2, Magic Eden and Tensor.</p><h3>Phantom Hardware Wallet Integration</h3><p>If you're looking to use Phantom to manage Solana and SPL tokens on your <a href=""/review/ledger-nano-s-plus-review/"">Ledger hardware wallet</a>, you'll first have to enable ""blind signing."" However, if you have already installed the Solana, Ethereum and Polygon apps onto your Ledger, then you can skip this step.</p><p>Once you've connected your Ledger wallet with Phantom, you can send/deposit funds using the Ledger accounts you've connected in the networks you selected to interact with Solana, Ethereum and Polygon dApps using your Ledger device.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Ledger_ff917de69e.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Ledger integration"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Ledger_ff917de69e.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Ledger_ff917de69e.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>You can connect your Ledger hardware wallet with Phantom.

But that mumbo jumbo is meant to authenticate your identity. When you connect your wallet to an app, most wallets share your address without verifying that the private keys are in your control.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Untitledfff_b3bbcd3428.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet Transaction Signing"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Untitledfff_b3bbcd3428.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Untitledfff_b3bbcd3428.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>What a typical authentication message looks like.

You can turn your Phantom Wallet into a Solana-focused experience.</p><p>Once you switch to the Solana-only mode, you can manage your Solana accounts, balances, tokens and NFTs without seeing other chains, network icons or EVM addresses. If you'd like to return to Phantom Multichain, you can do so by turning off the Solana-only toggle in the menu. Switching between the two modes doesn't disrupt account balances or assets.</p><h2>Is Phantom Wallet Safe?</h2><h3>Phantom Wallet Security</h3><p>The bedrock of any crypto wallet is its emphasis on security. Cryptocurrencies operate on the principles of trustless transactions and immutable ledgers, which mandate rigorous security protocols.</p><p>Phantom Wallet's code has been independently <a href=""https://kudelskisecurity.com/audits/?_sft_audit-projects=phantom"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">audited</a> by <a href=""https://kudelskisecurity.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kudelski Security</a>. In addition, its scam detection flags malicious transactions instantly. There's also a bounty program that pays white hat hackers up to $50,000 if you find a vulnerability that may cause users to lose their money.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Security_50f358aae6.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet Security"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Security_50f358aae6.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Security_50f358aae6.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Security_50f358aae6.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Security_50f358aae6.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Phantom Wallet employs top-notch security measures. Image via <a href=""https://phantom.app/security"">Phantom Wallet</a></figcaption></figure><p>Here are a few other things to consider from a security perspective:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-custodial wallet:</strong> A self-custody wallet like Phantom provides users with full control and ownership over their private keys and digital assets. This means you'll have sole responsibility over transactions, including sending and receiving your digital assets. And because users control their private keys, they can maintain a higher level of privacy compared to custodial wallets, where third-party services might have access to transaction history and other user data.</li><li><strong>Transaction previews:</strong> Transaction previews act as a firewall that identifies malicious transactions and warns you before they're approved by you. They protect users against attacks such as phishing, dApp-level DNS hijacking and software supply chain attacks, among many others. It also provides users with real-time warnings and human-readable transaction context.</li><li><strong>Open-source block list: </strong>The company has an open-source and community-maintained block list of malicious domains that it blocks users from mistakenly connecting to. Once Phantom finds out about a malicious token or NFT, it adds the contract address and domain to the block list. This hides the NFT from the wallet and creates a warning if the user tries to connect to the site. This block list is updated every day and currently houses over 2,000 domains.</li><li><strong>Burn NFT:</strong> This feature is available across all devices, and it allows for the manual removal of any unwanted spam NFTs. Once an NFT is burned, it results in the permanent removal of the digital collectible from your Phantom Wallet. In return, you're rewarded with Solana tokens. This is because when you burn an NFT, you are reclaiming some of the SOL that a scammer spent on sending you an NFT in the first place.</li></ul><h2>How To Install the Phantom Browser Extension</h2><p>To ensure you download the official Phantom extension and not a malicious app, it's best to download Phantom Wallet directly from the <a href=""https://phantom.app/download"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">company's website</a>.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Download_af91a82396.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet Download"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Download_af91a82396.jpg 231w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Download_af91a82396.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Download_af91a82396.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Download_af91a82396.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>To ensure you're not the victim of a scam, you should download the browser extension from the company's website.

After installing, you should see Phantom open in a new tab.</p><p>In order for Phantom to work, you'll have to grant it permission to ""read and change all your data on all websites."" The company explains that this permission is needed so dApps can engage with the blockchain network and access public wallet data such as your NFTs, transaction history or token balances.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Permissions_bce9d5c5fd.jpg"" alt=""Phantom Wallet Guide"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Permissions_bce9d5c5fd.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Permissions_bce9d5c5fd.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>In order for Phantom to work on your browser, you'll have to grant it this permission.

One difference is that you'll have to enable biometric security using a fingerprint or facial recognition to ensure you're the only one with access to the wallet. Once that's done, you'll be presented with your secret recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase.</p><p>If you have an existing wallet, you can simply enter your recovery phrase and restore your wallet on Phantom.</p><h2>How to Use Phantom Wallet</h2><p>As far as crypto wallets go, Phantom Wallet is pretty standard. As you're aware by now, you can use Phantom on certain web browsers and your mobile phone.</p><p>Once you've downloaded the extension for your browser, you can either choose to create a new wallet or restore an existing wallet to Phantom. If you're importing a wallet to Phantom, simply enter your seed phrase to restore your wallets.</p><p>If you create a new wallet, you'll be asked to create a password. Once you've chosen a strong password, select ""continue."" You'll then be presented with your confidential recovery phrase. It's <strong>extremely important</strong> that you write this down and store it in a safe location We cover this step in great detail in our <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">Crypto Safety Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Phantom has an integration with 1Password for the safe storage of recovery phrases. Next, you'll find the keyboard shortcuts to access the Phantom app. Select ""continue"" and you're all set.</p><p>Setting up Phantom Wallet on your mobile phone works in the same manner.</p><h2>Phantom vs. MetaMask Comparison</h2><figure class=""table""><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Phantom</strong></td><td><strong>MetaMask</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Number of users</td><td>Over 3 million</td><td>Over 30 million</td></tr><tr><td>Year released</td><td>2021</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>Blockchain supported</td><td>Solana, Ethereum and Polygon</td><td>Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche</td></tr><tr><td>Type of wallet</td><td>Software, non-custodial</td><td>Software, non-custodial</td></tr><tr><td>Browser extension</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile app</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Token swap</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Swap fee</td><td>0.85%</td><td>0.875%</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware wallet integration</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As you can see, Phantom Wallet and MetaMask have more similarities than differences.

Note that any funds on the exchange are under their custody, so not necessarily the safest place to store your crypto. It's preferable to store them in a <a href=""/education/types-of-crypto-wallets/"">crypto wallet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A crypto wallet is a device, which can be virtual or an actual thing, that holds the private keys needed to access your crypto on the blockchain, <i>not the actual funds</i>. Whoever holds the private keys is allowed to move the funds out of the blockchain where they are stored. With an exchange, the funds are stored in an account with a wallet address and these funds are ultimately controlled by the exchange. The only thing you can do is trust that they won't move your funds without first obtaining your permission or go bankrupt and lose all your assets.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're new to crypto and still learning the ropes, <a href=""/review/okx-wallet"">OKX has its own wallet</a> that you can store funds in. It removes the third-party risk associated with keeping funds on the exchange. Aside from having ownership of your own funds, you can also explore the world of DeFi and Web3 through the wallet. &nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OKX_Wallet_f6483fb07d.png"" alt=""OKX Wallet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OKX_Wallet_f6483fb07d.png 172w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OKX_Wallet_f6483fb07d.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_OKX_Wallet_f6483fb07d.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_OKX_Wallet_f6483fb07d.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>OKX wallet for your Web3 needs.

However, it is vulnerable to risks such as hacking into the wallet itself or your funds can be drained by giving permission for other DApps to access it automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>The next level-up option is a cold wallet, also known as a <a href=""/analysis/best-hardware-wallets/"">hardware wallet</a>. This type of wallet is not connected to the Internet and it requires an actual hardware device, usually the size of a USB key or something similar. What keeps this wallet safe is that it's not constantly connected to the Internet, so less chances of someone being able to hack into your wallet to gain access to your private keys.&nbsp;</p><p>The downside though is that these wallets aren't free and you will need to take very good care of your devices and make sure no one else who is not authorised has access to it.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about wallets by reading about <a href=""https://www.coinbureau.com/education/types-of-crypto-wallets"">the types of crypto wallets available</a> or <a href=""https://www.coinbureau.com/education/how-do-hardware-wallets-work"">how hardware wallets work</a> before deciding on whether you need one.</p><p>We also go into far greater detail on the security strengths and weaknesses of crypto storage devices in our <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">Crypto Safety Guide</a>.</p><h2>How to Convert Bitcoin to Fiat Currency with OKX</h2><p>OKX has no option for cash withdrawals, only crypto withdrawals are permitted. Users on OKX are able to withdraw Bitcoin or any other supported cryptocurrencies, or sell Bitcoin for stablecoins and withdraw fiat-pegged stablecoins to a wallet or another exchange as an alternative. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@coinbureau?lang=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg"" alt=""CoinBureau-Blog-TikTok-Banner.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The OKX platform is a solid one for all manners of trading. They also encourage exploration of the DeFi and Web3 space by onboarding people via their own OKX wallet and making the interface very user-friendly for navigation. This is accomplished by removing some of the barriers such as constantly signing messages to allow the DApps to access your wallet. For those who crave convenience but are ok to forego a bit of security, this is not a problem at all.&nbsp;</p><p>KYC is firmly in the face of the user as it appears there is little you can do without it. &nbsp;This is good news for those who are concerned about regulations but not desirable for those who are privacy-focused. Security is also something that the exchange excels at, taking one of the most comprehensive approaches to security in the industry and it has not suffered a hack so far, knocking on wood.&nbsp;</p><p>We invite you to learn more about the platform through our <a href=""/review/okx"">thorough OKX review</a> so that you can decide for yourself if this platform has what it takes to fulfil your needs.</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Press Release/token2049-largest-web-3-event-press-release/,TOKEN2049: Set to Be Largest Web3 Event in the World!,Press Release,"<p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>TOKEN2049 Singapore Set to Be World’s Largest Web3 Event With Over 10,000</strong><br><strong>Attendees&nbsp;</strong></p><p style=""text-align:center;""><br>● Not only Asia’s largest Web3 event, this year’s conference is expected to be the world’s largest of its kind<br>● TOKEN2049 has already surpassed last year’s registration and sponsorship numbers with numbers steadily<br>climbing ahead of September<br>● Speaker highlights include prolific entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan; Ethereum Co-Founder Joe Lubin; Galaxy<br>Digital CEO Mike Novogratz</p><p><strong>SINGAPORE — 6 June 2023</strong> — <a href=""https://www.asia.token2049.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TOKEN2049</a>, Asia’s premier Web3 and crypto conference, has announced its first<br>batch of high-profile title sponsors and headline speakers for its much-anticipated Singapore return.

The following section explores crypto copy trading and how it works.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>""Trade with the best and benefit from the pros."" Source: Bitget</p></blockquote><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_252ebf6b33.png"" alt=""Bitget Copy Trading""><figcaption>Bitget Has 100k Professional Traders You Can Follow: Image Source: Bitget</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is Crypto Copy Trading?</h2><p>Cryptocurrency copy trading offers a fantastic opportunity for traders to adopt the <a href=""/trading/crypto-trading-strategies/"">strategies</a> of crypto trading experts without having to trade themselves. With this automated method, you can dive into buying and selling crypto assets to reap profits without spending endless hours researching or mastering the complexities of cryptocurrency trading.</p><h3>How Does Copy Trading Work?</h3><p>Cryptocurrency copy trading is all about recognising skilled copy traders and automatically replicating their moves. Instead of analysing market trends, studying fundamentals, or deciphering complex trading methods, copy trading software mirrors the actions of the elite Bitget traders.</p><p>Suppose the Bitget trader you're copying places a <a href=""/review/dogecoin-doge/"">Dogecoin</a> (DOGE) sell order with a 1:3 RTR (risk-to-reward ratio) and a set exit point. The copy trading software automatically replicates the same order for your account within your chosen parameters for risk and drawdown.&nbsp;</p><p>Copy trading is a clever way for novice and seasoned traders to leverage the expertise of others and develop their investment skills.</p><p>On the other hand, you could join trading groups on platforms like Facebook (Meta) or Telegram to receive advice on cryptocurrency trading strategies or follow trade signals. However, remember that trading comes with significant risks. It's hugely challenging to master crypto trading, and most novice traders eventually give up after <a href=""https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/if-you-re-day-trading-you-will-probably-lose-money-here-s-why-1030667770"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">taking substantial losses.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Putting yourself in the hands of a skilled and experienced trader means you relinquish the need to get involved in the trading process other than setting up your account. For many novice traders, it's an excellent hands-off approach to trading.</p><p>Of course, Nothing is a sure shot in the volatile crypto market. People often confuse copy trading with ""social trading"", which involves seasoned traders suggesting which crypto assets to buy or sell. Social trading is a manual process, leaving room for potential errors and reducing the probability of success.&nbsp;</p><p>You can still become part of a trading community and learn from others. Bitget copy traders have over 410k followers (August 2023). Maybe, one day, you might develop the confidence to learn trading to a reasonable level to start trading yourself and earn income off of traders who want to copy your trades.</p><p>Cryptocurrency copy trading provides a more automated and reliable way to follow experts' moves and potentially earn profits. It's a popular choice for traders looking to boost their crypto game.</p><h2>Benefits of Crypto Copy Trading</h2><p>There are multiple benefits to crypto copy trading. In this section, we will explore the main advantages of Bitget copy trading and discover if there are any cons to copy trading.</p><h3>#1: Copy Trading Is Great For Novice Traders</h3><p>Learning how to trade cryptocurrencies is not easy. There's a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/day-trading-bitcoin-why-95-of-traders-lose-money-and-fail"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">95% failure rate</a> for new traders, and even seasoned traders can take many years to develop sufficient skills to make consistent monthly profits. In addition, the crypto market is incredibly challenging, with high volatility causing random price spikes and long periods of inactivity.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, with over 23,500 listed cryptocurrencies and hundreds of crypto exchanges, figuring out how and where to start can be overwhelming. Copy trading is a hands-off approach, only requiring understanding and researching trader's profiles to find the one most aligned with your trading goals.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2: Copy Trading Saves Learning Time</h3><p>Most novice traders don't appreciate how time-consuming becoming a successful crypto trader is. If you're working full time, you may not have access to the crypto market at peak times, when liquidity is highest. In addition, you have the task of learning the best trading strategies, technical and fundamental analysis and what indicators to use.&nbsp;</p><p>Realistically, it can take many years to master <a href=""/trading/basics-of-crypto-trading/"">crypto trading</a>, with no guarantee of success.</p><p>Copy trading is a simple way to learn about trading from professional crypto copy traders. It's not without risk, and one of the things you will learn is how to manage risk. Still, copy trading will save you time and reduce the chances of blowing your account if you choose a successful Bitget trader.</p><h3>#3: Learn Effective Risk Management&nbsp;</h3><p>Once you choose a trader to follow, you can adjust the risk parameters in your account. For example, you can assign lot size, maximum drawdown, and RTR (risk to reward) ratio; you might choose a 1:3 RTR meaning one win equals three losses before denting your trading capital.</p><p>Let's be clear. Copy trading is not without risk. However, the main reasons for losses are caused by not adhering to sound risk management and going after the big wins instead.&nbsp;</p><p>We recommend, if possible, risking no more than 1% of your account per trade because you would need one hundred losses before losing your entire trading capital.&nbsp;</p><h3>#4: Learn From Seasoned Crypto Traders</h3><p>Very few crypto traders go straight into profitable trading. Most traders started where you are. However, they have spent time mastering their skills and mindset in the trading arena. They may have traded multiple financial instruments or have deep knowledge of the crypto market.</p><p>Some Bitget traders enjoy interacting with their followers and building a loyal community. They may encourage their followers to ask questions, which is great because it allows you to learn the best crypto trading practices and how to develop solid <a href=""/education/crypto-trading-psychology/"">trading psychology</a>.</p><h3>#5: You Don't Need Deep Crypto Market Knowledge</h3><p>It may help your stress levels if you have some knowledge of the crypto market so you understand what's happening if a trade is in drawdown. Market analysis can baffle novice traders, but it can come quite naturally for expert traders. They develop the eye to spot market signals. They know when to enter and exit and trade and how to analyse the reasons for crypto price action.&nbsp;</p><h3>#6: Copy Trading Minimises Emotional Reactivity</h3><p>Professional crypto traders have mastered trading psychology. They remain calm whether the trade wins or loses because they understand the long game. They stick to their risk management, trading plan and trusted strategies.</p><p>Emotions aren't entirely void from copy trading, but a lot depends on your approach. If you choose a profitable trader with consistent results and only check your trades at the end of the day or week, your emotions will stay in check. However, if you watch every trade, you will experience heightened emotions, which can be stressful.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_9a4051701d.png"" alt=""What is Bitget Copy Trading""><figcaption>Join the Bitget Copy Trading Platform If You Are a Professional Crypto Trader: Image Source: Bitget</figcaption></figure><h2>Is Copy Trading Only For Beginners?</h2><p>No, copy trading has multiple benefits for all levels of crypto enthusiasts and traders.&nbsp;</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li><strong>Novice Traders: </strong>If you are brand new to trading and don't understand the crypto market, copy trading can be an option for learning the art of trading from professional crypto traders.</li><li><strong>Intermediate Traders: </strong>Perhaps you have some trading experience but are short on time or want to learn from someone more advanced. Copy trading gives you access to proven experts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Experienced Traders: </strong>Some top traders use copy trading to create additional income. With thousands of cryptos available, trading all of the assets you would like is impossible. Professional traders can do well because they know the attributes and traits required for successful traders.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Whatever level you are, copy trading is a hands-off approach to crypto trading. Professional traders may have a crypto specialism, such as trading Bitcoin, and are unfamiliar with Ethereum (ETH) price action but want to diversify. Therefore, they may seek a copy trader with in-depth <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum</a> (ETH) experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitget has over 100,000 elite traders. If you have a proven history of trading success, you can apply to become a Bitget elite trader. Once approved, you can share your techniques and strategies with your followers and earn a passive income by allowing them to copy your trades. You can choose to have a public profile or remain anonymous.</p><h2>Are There Any Risks In Copy Trading?</h2><p>Yes, even professional traders have losing streaks. Choosing a trader who consistently trades low-risk strategies and has verifiable proof of results is essential.&nbsp;</p><p>Selecting a more Gung-Ho trader with higher risk may work out for a while, but it does increase the risk potential.</p><p>To protect your Bitget account, set risk parameters for reduced risk, such as maximum <a href=""https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/what-is-drawdown-video"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">drawdown</a>, <a href=""https://www.thebalancemoney.com/risk-to-reward-ratio-1031350"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">RTR</a> and <a href=""https://www.ig.com/en/glossary-trading-terms/lot-definition"">lot size</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>What Should You Do Before Starting Copy Trading?</h3><p>It's easy to think you can start copying trades without knowledge, but that's not true. Taking time to understand the basics of crypto trading can significantly impact your copy trading results.&nbsp;</p><p>We recommend gaining basic knowledge of the following: -</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li>How the cryptocurrency market works</li><li><a href=""/education/crypto-technical-analysis/"">Technical</a>, fundamental and sentiment analysis</li><li>Lot sizes, order types, stop loss and limit orders</li><li><a href=""https://www.dailyfx.com/education/forex-trading-basics/risk-management-techniques-for-trading.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Risk management</a>: How to protect your trading account</li><li>The difference between crypto projects and token utility</li><li><a href=""/education/crypto-trading-psychology/"">Trading psychology</a>: The kind of mindset required for trading</li></ul><p>You may have seen negative reviews of crypto copy trading platforms, but we'd guess that many followers fail to grasp the basics of crypto education. If you have an idea of what's happening on the charts, you will find it less stressful and emotionally triggering.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Select the Best Crypto Copy Trading Platforms</h2><p>There are several factors to consider when choosing a suitable crypto copy trading platform.</p><p>Firstly, always select an established crypto platform like Bitget with a good <a href=""/analysis/is-bitget-safe/"">security</a> and customer care reputation, ideally licenced by financial governing bodies.&nbsp;</p><h3>Trusted Traders With Documented Results</h3><p>When researching a copy trader, observe the number of followers with live trading accounts. If the trader only has a handful of followers, looking for another with several thousand followers might be best. Even though all traders have to start somewhere, proof of results is a good start.&nbsp;</p><p>Carefully read the elite trader's profile and assess their risk management and results.&nbsp;</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li>ROI</li><li>Win rate</li><li>Watchers</li><li>Total profit</li><li>Total trades</li><li>Total assets</li><li>Days joined</li><li>Max drawdown</li><li>Number of followers</li></ul><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_e6433a8be2.png"" alt=""Bitget Copy Trading Review""><figcaption>Click on a Trader's Profile and Assess The Primary Factors of Success: Image Source: Bitget</figcaption></figure><h3>Evidence of Returns</h3><p>Following traders with high annual returns may seem attractive, but such strategies are often higher risk and tricky to maintain. Look at the analysis section on the trader's profile and observe if growth is like a rollercoaster or shows a slow, steady uptrend. The latter is preferable. The former may be evidence of a trader with a high-risk approach or a gambling mindset. Anyone can be lucky for a period but not for the long term.&nbsp;</p><h3>Risk Scores</h3><p>Choose a trader with a low and consistent risk score, which will help reduce the dangers of high drawdown. Ideally, look for statistics of a 20% drawdown or less.</p><p>It's advisable not to follow a trader who doesn't use a stop loss for all orders. We assume professional traders naturally have a stop loss to protect their (and your) account, but it's surprising how many traders wing it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Type of Trader</h3><p>Does your chosen trader swing or day trade or use a scalping strategy? Scalpers take multiple trades daily. Day traders open and close a few trades daily, and swing traders may hold trades for days, weeks or months. Assess what trading style suits your personality and stress levels.&nbsp;</p><p>The trading style also affects how many trades a copy trader takes. Swing traders have fewer trades than scalp traders. Measure the number of trades against the profitability and consistency of results.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, how active is your chosen elite trader? Are they available to the community or disappear for days or weeks without explanation? As with every aspect of copy trading, consistency is the primary goal. If you notice the trader switching strategies, increasing lot sizes and risk against their account, it may be time to unfollow.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also want to choose a specialist for a specific cryptocurrency, such as a Bitcoin expert.</p><h2>How To Copy Trade On Bitget</h2><p>The first step to setting up your account for copy trading is to choose a nickname. It's optional, but Bitget uses your email address or phone number as the default nickname if you opt-out. Your nickname can be a mix of letters, numbers and special characters.</p><p>After that, upload an up-to-date profile photo.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>You cannot change the profile name or nickname once set up.</p><p>Customer service will then review and, hopefully, approve your account. After that, take the following steps: -&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a trader to follow: On the Copy Trade page, look for a suitable elite trader to follow.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_deadb047e0.png"" alt=""How to Copy Trade on Bitget""><figcaption>On The Bitget Copy Trade Webpage, click on ""Follow:"" Image Source: Bitget</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_487df301c3.png"" alt=""A screenshot of a phone\n\nDescription automatically generated""><figcaption>On the Bitget App, Click on ""Copy"" to Follow A Trader: Image Source: Bitget</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose A contract type, follow mode, risk management and leverage.

For example, you can copy trade only 3 BTC/USDT trades but 30 ETH/USD per order.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We recommend checking your copy trading account frequently to ensure you have sufficient funds and are happy with the copy trader's risk management and results.</p><p>Before activating your copy trades, it is helpful to check Bitget trading fees.</p><h2>Bitget Trading Fees</h2><p>Bitget trading fees are competitive: -</p><figure class=""table""><table><tbody><tr><td style=""border:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.25pt;"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""border-bottom-style:solid;border-color:windowtext;border-left-style:none;border-right-style:solid;border-top-style:solid;border-width:1.0pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.25pt;"">Maker Fees</td><td style=""border-bottom-style:solid;border-color:windowtext;border-left-style:none;border-right-style:solid;border-top-style:solid;border-width:1.0pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.3pt;"">Taker Fees</td></tr><tr><td style=""border-bottom-style:solid;border-color:windowtext;border-left-style:solid;border-right-style:solid;border-top-style:none;border-width:1.0pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.25pt;"">Spot Trading</td><td style=""border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-left-style:none;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-top-style:none;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.25pt;"">0.1%</td><td style=""border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-left-style:none;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-top-style:none;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.3pt;"">0.08%</td></tr><tr><td style=""border-bottom-style:solid;border-color:windowtext;border-left-style:solid;border-right-style:solid;border-top-style:none;border-width:1.0pt;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.25pt;"">Futures Trading</td><td style=""border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-left-style:none;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-top-style:none;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.25pt;"">0.02%</td><td style=""border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-left-style:none;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-top-style:none;padding:0cm 5.4pt;vertical-align:top;width:150.3pt;"">0.04%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Withdrawal fees are variable, depending on the asset.

Bitget supports transparency, so you will know potential costs before following a trader.</p><h2>What Is The Difference Between Social, Copy And Mirror Trading?</h2><p>There are several differences between social, copy and mirror trading. This section goes behind the scenes to explain how they differ—the positives and downsides and what type of copy replication might suit you best.</p><h3>Mirror Trading: A Hands-Off Approach</h3><p>Mirror trading is when you copy the trading strategies of other traders. Companies offering a mirror trading service combine the best-performing strategies of their top traders to give reliable signals.&nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, mirror trading is smarter, using big data and artificial intelligence to make signals accurate and predictable. It's great for investors wanting an easy, hands-off crypto trading experience.</p><p>The only downside is that mirror trading requires you to copy everything – you can't choose specific signals to follow. The entire process is automated, so you don't have much control.&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror trading requires special software or a MetaTrader plugin that does it all for you to do mirror trading.</p><h3>Copy Trading: Emulate Top Traders</h3><p>Copy trading is a more advanced version of mirror trading. Unlike mirror trading, where you must follow all signals without control, copy trading allows you to select specific traders whose trades you want to copy. Your trading account automatically copies a trade whenever the chosen trader opens a trade.</p><p>Copy trading is still automated, but you can switch between traders and follow their strategies at different times. In addition, you can even choose to follow multiple traders for various currency pairs, depending on the platform's capabilities.</p><p>One of the key benefits of following the best traders is that it provides an opportunity to learn from their strategies. You can monitor their open trades in real-time and try to understand the reasoning behind each trading decision they make.&nbsp;</p><p>Copy trading lets you gain valuable insights into successful trading techniques you may use later if you intend to start trading crypto yourself.</p><h3>Social Trading: Being Part of a Trading Team</h3><p>A popular copy trade service is social trading. It's a blend of mirror and copy trading with a social aspect. Unlike relying solely on automated signals and plugins, social trading lets you join a community of traders to engage in real-time discussions about market updates.</p><p>Social trading offers a learning opportunity for crypto trading novices. You won't have to guess the reasoning behind the trades, such as the technical and fundamental analysis. Instead, you'll have a group of traders to discuss the crypto market and make trading decisions together.&nbsp;</p><p>From experience, I know trading is a lonely game, so being part of a community can improve your trading skills as you learn from others.</p><p>The best part is that social trading is relatively safe because you retain complete control over your decisions. The signals and insights from the trading group or forum are only guidance and trading aids. This way, you'll master advanced trading strategies much faster and with the support of a knowledgeable community.</p><p>The downside of social trading is that executing successful trades relies on timing, and you need to understand the basics of completing an order and setting a stop loss and exit point. It sounds easy, but the tendency to interfere with trades is a daily reality for <a href=""/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/"">novice traders</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the proviso is that you join a reputable social trading community with a solid background in supporting its members.</p><p><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@coinbureau?lang=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg"" alt=""CoinBureau-Blog-TikTok-Banner.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Coin_Bureau_Blog_Tik_Tok_Banner_6c43c3059f.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Bitget Copy Trading Closing Thoughts</h2><p>Bitget's copy trading service is one of the most popular in the crypto space.

I remember, just 2 years ago, you could count the number of DEXes with one hand, at least the major ones. Gone are the days when all you need to pay attention to are <a href=""/review/uniswap-uni/"">Uniswap</a> on Ethereum, <a href=""/review/pancakeswap-cake/"">PancakeSwap</a> on BNB, and protocols like Aave or <a href=""/review/compound-finance-comp/"">Compound Finance</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, it seems like there is a DEX popping up every month on a blockchain that's nowhere near the top 100 on <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CoinGecko's list</a>. If you regularly participate in DEXes as a liquidity provider, scouting for arbitrage opportunities, or simply looking for a platform to perform some permissionless swaps, I have the right tool for you.</p><p><a href=""/deals/wallet/unstoppable-domains/""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg"" alt=""Unstoppable Domains Inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Introduction to GeckoTerminal</h2><p><a href=""https://www.geckoterminal.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GeckoTerminal</a> is a DEX tracking tool that tracks real-time prices, trading, and transaction volume across more than 600 DEXes on 100+ networks. You can see liquidity for 1.7 million pools for 1.5 million tokens. All prices are updated in real-time and reflected on the platform as and when the action happens, saving you the hassle of hunting through numerous tabs and potentially missing out on some juicy opportunities.</p><p>What sets GeckoTerminal apart from its competitors is the sheer number of networks they track, which is more than any in the market. It has, hands down, the most extensive information on what's going on in the world of DEXes, along with what we feel is the most user-friendly UX/UI for easy navigation. In addition, the selection of languages available to choose from easily beats other competitors who often only have English as the default display with no options for a different language.</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump right in and check out all the goodies on offer in GeckoTerminal. This is a great consideration as one of the top go-to tools for any degen trader or anyone interested in analyzing the world of decentralized exchanges.</p><h2>Getting Started with GeckoTerminal</h2><p>The first thing that hit me (and probably most users) is that there is A LOT of information on-screen. In the midst of the dazzling array of figures, my attention is drawn to the card-like slots near the top of the screen. These are the “Trends” that can be turned on and off by toggling the “Show Trend” button on the far right side of the screen.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Gecko_Terminal_Main_Page_bdf835da2b.png"" alt=""GeckoTerminal Main Page"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Gecko_Terminal_Main_Page_bdf835da2b.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Gecko_Terminal_Main_Page_bdf835da2b.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Gecko_Terminal_Main_Page_bdf835da2b.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Gecko_Terminal_Main_Page_bdf835da2b.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Plenty of Information to Keep the Nerdiest Data Lovers Happy in GeckoTerminal</figcaption></figure><p>All the way at the top are the overall metrics of GeckoTerminal showing what they track. If you have something specific in mind, the search bar is handily located at the top next to the logo, followed by the Public API documentation if that's what you're looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>On the left side of the screen is a list of blockchain networks supported by GeckoTerminal. You can see all the liquidity pools associated with that network by clicking on it. Other functionality of the platform is available here too. The rest of the page shows the list of liquidity pools across all the networks sorted by transactions in the last 24 hours by default. Clicking on any of the headings shows that column in ascending or descending order. If you'd like to hide the left-side panel, click on the three bars next to the logo.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, enough of the main page, let's go exploring to find more cool stuff!</p><h2>GeckoTerminal Features and Functions</h2><h3>Trend Cards</h3><p>Trend cards are the ones that are at the top part of the page as mentioned earlier.

All you have to do is click on the star icon next to a liquidity pool to add them to your list. You can create multiple watchlists to keep track of the different pools you may have your eye on.&nbsp;</p><p>One other neat feature of this page is the ability to change the display language to a non-English one. Currently, GeckoTerminal offers a total of 17 languages as options such as English, Chinese (both Simplified and Traditional), Indonesian, Turkish, and Dutch to name a few. Compared to other DEX tracking tools that only support English, this is the most user-friendly feature for non-English users. It also sends out a strong signal about the user base of the platform and/or the regions it plans to conquer.</p><h2>Multi-Protocol Support</h2><p>We've mentioned earlier how to drill down to a DEX for a closer look at the exchange. Let's turn our focus to just a few of the networks themselves that the DEXes run on and see what else we can discover. This is just a small sample of networks that are tracked by GeckoTerminal.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ethereum</h3><p>As the grandfather of smart-contract networks, <a href=""/education/what-is-ethereum/"">Ethereum</a> features the most DEXes of any blockchain. Most well-known DEXes in crypto land probably started off on Ethereum before branching out to other networks. When it comes to DeFi, Ethereum is still the premium network to be on. L2s like <a href=""/review/arbitrum/"">Arbitrum</a> and <a href=""/review/optimism-review/"">Optimism</a> may be catching up, but the prestige and network effects of being on Ethereum are still worth quite a lot, even if the high gas fees, relative to the rest, increase the cost of transactions on it. &nbsp;The 24H trading volume of around $1 billion says it all.</p><h3>Solana</h3><p>Long touted as an “ETH Killer” when it first came into being, it's jostling to be one of Ethereum's main competitors in the DeFi field. Criticisms of centralisation aside, <a href=""/review/solana-sol/"">Solana</a> has seen some decent volume through Orca and Raydium until the FTX scandal came along. Since then, things have been a lot quieter with a 24H volume of $16.77 million, a far cry from Ethereum's. So far, it seems to have gotten its network outage problem under control. The next step is to see how further development in the DEX space shapes up in the future.</p><h3>Fantom</h3><p>Despite having more DEXes than Solana, the 24H volume of $2.58 million shows that DEX quantity is less important. Of all the Layer 1 alternatives, this one is slightly on the fringe, just edging in but not quite. Yet it's interesting to see that Curve Finance, one of the top DeFi dApps, has set up a presence on this network. Spookyswap is <a href=""/review/fantom-ftm/"">Fantom's</a> most popular offering, with a 24H volume of half of the total volume on Fantom.</p><p>Below are some of the lesser-known chains so you have an idea of the variety of networks that GeckoTerminal tracks.</p><p><strong>Oasis Emerald</strong> - with 5 DEXes and a 24H volume of $26.2k, this is definitely one of the smaller fishes in the sea. The highest-ranked DEX in this network is Yuzuswap at position 200.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tomochain </strong>- only 1 DEX exists on this network, which is Luauswap. It still managed to get $12.87k for its 24H volume with 374 transactions in the same period.</p><p><strong>Milkomeda Cardano </strong>- even with the <a href=""/guides/top-cardano-projects-dapps/"">Cardano</a> flag waving high above its head, this network manages even less volume than Tomochain at $3,736.42 with 3 DEXes in its network&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wemix</strong> - this is another blockchain I've not heard of but it manages to pull in $128.4k which is probably not too bad, considering how crowded the marketplace already is and with only one DEX called WeMix.Fi</p><h2>GeckoTerminal API and Dev Tools</h2><p>In line with CoinGecko's practice of offering free public API keys, GeckoTerminal also has its own <a href=""https://www.geckoterminal.com/dex-api"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">API documentation</a> that's free to try. The API endpoints allow you to:</p><ul><li>Get the price, volume, and historical chart for any token as long as you have the token or pool address.&nbsp;</li><li>Track all pools that carry a specific token</li><li>Use OHLCV to plot a candlestick chart for a singular pool address.</li></ul><p>Currently, the API is in Beta mode and is subject to frequent changes. Anyone with a working knowledge of API is welcome to give the documentation a read. All endpoints are in RESTFUL JSON format which is a standard for API connectivity.</p><p>Please note that no authentication is required for now but users are subject to a universal rate limit. More information can be found on their <a href=""https://apiguide.geckoterminal.com/faq"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FAQ page</a>.</p><h2>Security Features</h2><p>GeckoTerminal is CoinGecko's DEX tracking offering to the crypto world. They are the main data source for powering all the metrics you see on the platform. This is a mostly view-only platform that allows limited interaction with users. Unlike CoinGecko which has a log-in function to use its portfolio tool and other services, GeckoTerminal holds no personal data in their databases. What they've done is basically cobbled together on-chain data that is readily available to the public and put on a user-friendly cover over it.&nbsp;</p><p>They use encrypted connections for data retrieval and routinely perform security audits as one of their numerous security measures. Strict access control is also in place to protect any transient data. Once retrieved, the data is stored in GeckoTerminal's cloud-based systems using best practices in the industry for data management.</p><p><a href=""https://t.me/cbinsider"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg"" alt=""Telegram Inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>GeckoTerminal Review: Conclusion</h2><p>The proliferation of networks and DEXes has evolved to the point where it necessitates a tracking tool of sorts to make sense of what's going on. The team at CoinGecko sees this opportunity and released GeckoTerminal to the world. The platform still has lots of room to grow, whether it's adding more customisation abilities or increasing user engagement with the platform. Perhaps a tie-in with CandyRewards by bringing over CoinGecko's loyalty users, a Connect Wallet feature that lets users perform swaps on their favorite DEX, or a mobile app version of the platform.</p><p>Whatever they choose to put on their roadmap, GeckoTerminal as it stands now has plenty to offer and is a great tool for learning about DEXes from a numbers point of view. In the meantime, I look forward to any new features they might release down the road.</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Analysis/top-polygon-projects/,Top 5 Projects on Polygon: Best Matic DApps to Watch!,Analysis,https://www.coinbureau.com/Guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-on-bitget/,How to Buy Bitcoin on Bitget,Guides,"<p>Whoop!

The exchange also has a hot wallet, or you may prefer a <a href=""/analysis/best-hardware-wallets/"">cold wallet</a> for the added security of a <a href=""/education/how-do-hardware-wallets-work/"">hardware wallet</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>The downside of a cold wallet is the cost involved, ranging from $50 and above. The upside is that a cold wallet is a tangible piece of hardware and is less vulnerable to hackers as it is offline.&nbsp;</p><p>Hot wallets are convenient, but you don't have as much control of your assets because an exchange – as the third-party - has access to your private keys. Whilst most reputable crypto exchanges, like Bitget, take security seriously, it's something to consider. We explore this concept further and highlight key differences between software (hot) and hardware (cold) in our article on <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">Crypto Safety: How to Keep Your Crypto Safe.</a></p><p>Bitget stores the majority of assets in a secure, multi-signature cold wallet.

Udi and Eric started the project as a response to the reluctant-to-change reaction from some Bitcoin community members after ordinals first entered the scene.

They have enabled the most immutable network in the world to secure more than just digital money. Existing ordinals could be the canary in the coal mine for what may be coming, a world where we leverage Bitcoin for ownership of digital items with next-level data immutability characteristics.

This is because the community is using the terms ordinals, inscriptions, and Bitcoin NFTs interchangeably, while there are distinctions between the three.</p><h3>What is an Ordinal?</h3><p>The traditional definition of an Ordinal originates from “<a href=""https://trustmachines.co/glossary/ordinal-theory/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ordinal Theory,</a>” a methodology where individual satoshis can be labelled and tracked. So, the most traditional definition of an ordinal is a singular individual satoshi that can be identified thanks to a numbering scheme.</p><h3>What is a Satoshi?</h3><p>Named after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, a satoshi (sat for short) is the very smallest unit of denomination of a Bitcoin, with every Bitcoin consisting of 100 million satoshis (sats). Sats make up a Bitcoin in a similar way that cents make up a dollar.</p><h3>What is an Inscription?</h3><p>An inscription is general arbitrary data and metadata posted to a Bitcoin transaction. The metadata are instructions on how to read said data, whether it is an image, text, audio, or other.</p><p>Inscriptions themselves are nothing new. Since the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade (BIP 141) to the Bitcoin Network in 2017, they have existed independently.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are Bitcoin NFTs?</h3><p>The marriage of the ideas behind ordinals and Inscriptions enables Bitcoin NFTs. An inscription is “bound” to an Ordinal, creating a sat with unique data attached, effectively creating an NFT.</p><p>Now that the distinction between the terms has been made, we note that seeing both Bitcoin NFTs, inscriptions, or simply ordinals to refer to Bitcoin NFTs may be expected. I believe the term ordinals will be the one to stick, given that it is the catchiest of the three and seems to have already been adopted by the community. Therefore, this article will refer to the idea of Bitcoin NFTs as ordinals.</p><h2>The difference between Bitcoin Ordinals and Ethereum NFTs</h2><p>In practice, ordinals and <a href=""/education/fundamental-analysis-of-nfts/"">Ethereum NFTs</a> work similarly. They represent unique digital assets with associated data. However, the two have vital technological differences, as highlighted in the table below.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_694719f27c.png"" alt=""Bitcoin and Ethereum NFTs compared"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_image_694719f27c.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_image_694719f27c.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_image_694719f27c.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_image_694719f27c.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>The tech differences between ordinals and Ethereum NFTs. Source: </i><a href=""https://www.galaxy.com/research/whitepapers/bitcoin-ordinals-inscriptions-5-billion-nft-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><i>Galaxy Research</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>The most critical difference highlighted above is whether the content is on-chain. Unlike traditional NFTs that utilize smart contracts and store the data in external systems, Ordinal NFT data is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. Fully on-chain content makes ordinals immutable. In contrast, Ethereum NFT data can sometimes be altered.</p><p>An additional essential difference not included above is that minting an ordinal is significantly more expensive than minting an NFT on Ethereum. At the average 2022 fee rate of 3 sats/vByte, inscribing a single Bored Ape NFT would cost 298,620 sats, which at the current Bitcoin price of around $30,000 per BTC equates to $89.59. This means the cost to mint the 10,000-unit BAYC collection would be close to $1 million. The high costs associated with ordinals are one of the reasons why most NFTs are simple pixelated artworks, as the minting fees vary proportionately with the size of the files being inscribed.</p><p>The features of higher costs and immutability make ordinals suited for differentiated use cases compared to Ethereum NFTs.</p><h2>Digital Artifacts</h2><p>Bitcoin Ordinal's properties make them perfect digital artifacts. What is a digital artifact? They are akin to physical artifacts, holding unique value in the digital sphere. They possess vital attributes: clear ownership, completeness, permissionless functionality, uncensorability, and immutability. Due to their intrinsic properties, Bitcoin ordinals perfectly embody these principles, thus standing as ideal digital artifacts.</p><p>Every Bitcoin Ordinal has a distinct owner, just like a rare physical artifact, differentiating it from unowned data. This explicit ownership lends significant value to these ordinals, heightening their appeal in the digital realm.</p><p>The attribute of completeness is crucial. Unlike some non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dependent on off-chain content, Bitcoin ordinals are complete entities within the blockchain itself. They carry all necessary information within the inscription, ensuring they are self-contained and not reliant on external data sources like Arweave or IPFS.</p><p>Permissionless operation is another cornerstone of digital artifacts. Bitcoin ordinals can be transferred freely without constraints such as royalty payments.</p><p>Finally, Bitcoin ordinals inherit the Bitcoin blockchain's immutability and censorship-resistant properties. They are resistant to change and censorship, offering a robust and unalterable record of existence. In this sense, they encapsulate the core principles of digital artifacts, preserving their integrity in the digital realm.</p><h2>The History of Ordinal NFTs</h2><p>Ordinals were made economically viable thanks to Bitcoin’s most recent major upgrade, <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Taproot (BIP 431),</a> activated in November 2021. Combined with the 2017 SegWit upgrade, it made it possible to wrap data cheaply into a taproot script stored in a transaction's witness data section.</p><p>But blockchain updates generally only lay the groundwork for new-use cases. For them to be made accessible, additional work from the community is required. Bitcoin ordinals reaching the mainstream only happened in December 2022, when Casey Rodarmor, a Bitcoin developer, released the <a href=""https://github.com/casey/ord"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ordinals protocol software</a>. The software runs on a Bitcoin full node on top of the Bitcoin core software, enabling minting and trading ordinals.</p><h2>Ordinals Have Been a Hit, With Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surging</h2><p>Once the Bitcoin ordinals protocol emerged, the idea of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain quickly caught the crypto community's attention. Since they came into the spotlight in January 2023, the growth of ordinals has been staggering. Over 15 million Bitcoin Ordinals have been created, and no signs of significant slowdowns exist.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_91b1c995f3.png"" alt=""Ordinal Inscriptions Dune"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_image_91b1c995f3.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_image_91b1c995f3.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_image_91b1c995f3.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_image_91b1c995f3.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>A look at daily and total ordinals created.

Today, daily network fees are a steady 2-3 times higher than throughout 2022. At one point this last May, transaction fees even spiked to levels not seen since the top of the 2017 bull run after a Bitcoin NFT and meme-coin craze.

The higher transaction fees illustrated in the previous section are the most apparent benefit. As a result, since the ordinals protocol emerged, the amount of BTC in blocks originating from transactions is substantially higher.</p><p>For instance, in June 2023, 46.5 BTC per day coming for transactions were mined on average, almost 3x the amount in June 2022. The figures in May are even more pronounced. Fees now constitute a much higher % of the total BTC available per block, as shown in the chart below.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_2c0040c4a4.png"" alt=""Transaction Fees Mined"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_image_2c0040c4a4.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_image_2c0040c4a4.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_image_2c0040c4a4.png 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Daily Transaction Fee Revenue and the Share of the Total Block Rewards made by Transaction Fees Source: Coinbureau with data from </i><a href=""https://bitcoinvisuals.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><i>Bitcoin Visuals</i></a></figcaption></figure><p>The second way ordinals benefit miners is by offering more consistent, more valuable blocks. This is because users minting ordinals can be buyers of blockspace when blocks are not whole. This can happen as inscribers can wait until average fee rates drop to finalize their transactions, as creating ordinals may not be as time-sensitive as financial transactions. If we see this pattern of behavior, blocks are likely to be full more consistently, thereby increasing the BTC per block floor.</p><h2>How Do Ordinals Impact the Security of the Bitcoin Network?</h2><p>The Bitcoin halving happening every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years, is perceived positively. Traditionally, bitcoin’s price has rallied following a halving, and by more than a factor of 2. This is important because, for every halving, Bitcoin’s security budget also drops by around 50%, meaning a price increase of 2x or more is needed to ensure that the security budget of the network doesn’t fall.</p><p>However, the price of BTC increasing by a factor of 2 or more is not guaranteed, and with each halving, whether sooner or later, block rewards will be inevitably small given the math behind BTC supply. To ensure a healthy security budget, it is therefore critical that miners accrue a substantial amount of transaction fees.</p><p>Here is where ordinals could play a significant part. Ordinal fees can increase the profitability for miners and thus contribute positively to Bitcoin's security budget. Overall, Ordinal’s impact on miners and Bitcoin's long-term security model appears to be largely positive.</p><p><i><strong>We have seen the first signs of block reward independence, shedding some light on a future where the Bitcoin security budget is less likely to be compromised.</strong></i></p><h2>How to Buy, Sell, and Trade Ordinals</h2><p>The ordinals protocol uses the Bitcoin Taproot update; therefore, a taproot-compatible wallet with a taproot address is required. A wallet with “coin control” capabilities that prevent spending inscribed ordinal satoshis is also needed.</p><p>Note that many popular wallets may not be compatible due to these requirements. This is because many wallets may only support taproot or see all sats as the same, with ordinal inscription distinctions.</p><p>Popular taproot-compatible wallets are the <a href=""https://ordinalswallet.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ordinals Wallet</a>, <a href=""https://www.xverse.app/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Xverse</a>, and <a href=""https://unisat.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Unisat</a>. The typical user journey involved in buying Bitcoin ordinals is similar to purchasing non-Bitcoin NFTs, which is as follows:</p><ol style=""list-style-type:decimal;""><li>Create an ordinals wallet. This can be done through the webpage of one of the wallets mentioned.</li><li>Take a backup of the recovery phrase for the wallet.</li><li>Set up a password to access the wallet.</li><li>Send some sats to the wallet using the address or buy some bitcoin via built-in onramp services.</li><li>Go to an ordinals marketplace such as <a href=""http://gamma.io"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gamma.io</a></li><li>Find your favorite ordinal.</li><li>Buy the ordinal using the sats in the wallet.</li></ol><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/image_d4477a3ec6.png"" alt=""image.png"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_image_d4477a3ec6.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_image_d4477a3ec6.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_image_d4477a3ec6.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_image_d4477a3ec6.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Bitcoin ordinals marketplace Gamma. Source: </i><a href=""http://Gamma.io"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><i>Gamma.io</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i></figcaption></figure><p>As a nascent technology, the tools around Bitcoin ordinals are still at a very early stage. With more users drawn to ordinals, the ecosystem, and the tooling will mature to provide a more intuitive user experience.</p><h2>How to Create Bitcoin Ordinals</h2><p>Until recently, the only way to create ordinals was with a fully synced Bitcoin node, which can be costly and requires a technically competent user. Now inscription services like Gamma and Ordinals Bot provide more user-friendly ways to inscribe Bitcoin ordinals suited for non-technical users.</p><p>1. Create an ordinals wallet. This can be done through the webpage of one of the wallets mentioned. Follow steps 1-4 above.</p><p>2. Connect to an inscription service like <a href=""http://Gamma.io"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Gamma.io</a> or <a href=""https://ordinalsbot.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ordinalsbot</a></p><p>3. Select the type of file to inscribe. You can choose between an image, text, BRC-20 tokens, and even .sats, a name service similar to ENS. Remember that the file size will affect the transaction cost, anyone can view the file, and it cannot be changed or deleted.</p><p>4. Enter the taproot-compatible wallet address where you wish to receive the NFT.</p><p>5. Choose your transaction fee. The higher the payment, the more likely it will be that the ordinal will be created sooner. However, keep in mind that the time it will take to make an ordinal will depend on Bitcoin's network congestion, and it is not guaranteed that a high fee will mine the NFT sooner than a lower fee at a time of lower congestion.</p><p>6. Inscribe the Ordinal NFT by sending the BTC requested. You’ll need to own some BTC to pay the transaction.</p><p>Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll get a link to see your inscription on the <a href=""https://ordinals.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ordinals explorer</a> and transaction data details.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Next for Ordinals?</h2><p>Bitcoin Ordinals are in their nascent stage, with continuous enhancements to the technology and associated tools. The earliest developments were driven by a need to rectify some issues, but more recently, enhancements focused on performance and user-friendliness.</p><h3>The Cursed Ordinals Issue.</h3><p>The term ""cursed inscriptions"" pertains to ordinals rendered invalid due to incorrect usage or intentional misuse of opcodes. These ""cursed"" entities could not be recognized or traded, limiting their usability within the ordinal's ecosystem. However, a new upgrade to the ordinals protocol, version 0.6.0, has started to address this issue by indexing these previously unrecognized Bitcoin ordinals.</p><p>The solution proposed by ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor involved transforming these cursed inscriptions into ""blessed"" ones. This transformation consists in introducing support for a subset of the different types of cursed ordinals, achieved by setting a block activation height at which specific types of previously invalid inscriptions would start being indexed as regular, valid ordinals. This transformation would solve some pain points around the 70,000 affected ordinals.</p><h3>Ordinals Recursive Inscriptions</h3><p>More recently, on the 4th of July, Bitcoin ordinals entered a new era with the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.theblock.co/post/237658/bitcoin-ordinals-brc-69"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">BRC-69 standard</a>. This game-changing development reduces the cost of Bitcoin ordinals by 90% and removes the existing data limit, previously constrained by Bitcoin’s block size of 4 Mb.&nbsp;</p><p>This innovation is based on ""recursive inscriptions,"" a process that allows inscriptions to request data from existing ones. This can be used in many ways. For instance, rather than inscribing 10,000 JPEG files for, let's say, the BAYC collection, which would be expensive, as we saw earlier, you could use recursive inscriptions to make everything more lightweight. It could be possible to inscribe the 200 traits from the collection and then make 10,000 low-memory inscriptions to request traits and programmatically render the image, resulting in significant cost savings.&nbsp;</p><p>The use cases are not limited to images, there have already been text and audio files also inscribed. Bitcoin is getting a more advanced file system, meaning that building more complex and elaborate systems will make pushing the innovation frontier even more attainable.</p><p><a href=""https://t.me/cbinsider"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg"" alt=""Telegram Inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Telegram_inline_fe7d5fe2dc.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h2>Ordinals Have Changed The Ethos of the Bitcoin Blockchain</h2><p>What was traditionally a blockchain for peer-to-peer financial transactions is now evolving into a network that can do more, and Ordinals are the technology behind this movement.

Recently, <a href=""https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1678049715194150913?s=20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Vitalik Buterin spoke positively</a> about the impact of ordinals on Bitcoin's future, stating:</p><blockquote><p>“I definitely see signs of hope now that we have ordinals bringing back a culture of doing things.

If you're <a href=""/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/"">new to the crypto market</a>, you may wonder what would happen if the platform got hacked or some other catastrophic event caused the loss of your digital assets. Don't worry. In this section, you will learn the security measures Binance takes to protect your account.</p><h3>Binance Key Security Features</h3><p>Binance has several security features that contribute to protecting assets held on the platform by registered users.</p><h3>Safeguarding Your Funds: The Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU)</h3><p>In 2018, the Binance platform introduced a type of insurance fund referred to as the Secure Asset Fund for Users, or “SAFU” for short. The SAFU acts as an emergency reserve to protect user assets on the Binance platform. In the unlikely event that the platform gets hacked or anything causes users to lose digital assets (From Binance's perspective), the SAFU reimburses users.&nbsp;</p><p>The SAFU doesn't cover trading losses or any self-generated losses. For instance, it's your mistake if you lose your crypto wallet keys, mishandle your password, or cannot access your Binance account because you made a mistake. However, if a hacker gets your data or assets from a vulnerability in Binance's security systems, that is the responsibility of the platform to compensate your losses.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>""Binance stores 10% of all trading fees in a secure asset fund to protect a share of user funds."" (Source: Binance).</p></blockquote><h3>Two Factor Authentication</h3><p><a href=""https://staysafeonline.org/online-safety-privacy-basics/its-easy-to-stay-safe-online-with-these-4-steps-plus-1/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2FA</a> isn't mandatory with Binance, but we highly recommend it as a security protocol. If someone accesses your password and you don't have 2FA enabled, you might only realize there was unauthorized access to your account when you log in and find your account balance is zero.</p><p>2FA acts as a stop measure, meaning that even if a hacker gets your password, they cannot access your account or make a withdrawal without also having access to your mobile device, which is also likely password-protected.</p><h3>Organizational Security</h3><p>Binance has several infrastructure features to ensure the integrity and safety of your funds (for the wallet and on the platform), including TSS (<a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/276"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">threshold signature schemes</a>), a cryptographic protocol for distributed key signing and distribution, and multisig (multiple signatures).</p><h3>Proof of Reserves (PoR)</h3><blockquote><p>""Binance has funds that cover all of our users assets 1:1, as well as some reserves."" (Source: <a href=""https://www.binance.com/en/proof-of-reserves"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Binance</a>).</p></blockquote><p>In February 2023, Binance became the first centralised crypto exchange (CEX) to implement <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zksnark.asp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">zk-SNARKS</a>, which are zero-knowledge protocols to increase the security and privacy of user data during verification.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Binance made the code open-source to further benefit the entire crypto industry security.</p><h3>Real-Time Monitoring</h3><p>Binance's risk management system analyses every 2FA&nbsp;or password reset, withdrawal attempt, and email address change.

We recommend setting up personalised access control from the start. Whitelisting wallets and IP addresses help to protect your account.</p><p>Binance encourages safe sign-in protocols, such as 2FA, including SMS, email, hardware and app-based. Due to what is known as a <a href=""https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/sim-swapping"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Sim-Swap attack</a>, most security professionals do not recommend using SMS, but opt for the more secure 2FA such as Google Authenticator or Authy on your mobile device or using a dedicated 2FA device like YubiKey.</p><p>It's advisable to use a super strong password along with a password manager. Use lower and upper case, digits and special characters. If you cannot remember your password without writing it down, that's a positive sign you have nailed a strong password, hence where a password manager can save the day.</p><p>Avoid using a generic password like Brian1234 or one you regularly use for other accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>By enabling notifications in your security settings, you can opt-in to receive security notifications from the Binance support team for login attempts. This can help identify if someone tries to get into your account pretending to be you.</p><p>Adding multiple layers to your account security is always a good plan.</p><blockquote><p>""Binance maintains completely separate ledgers for user funds, pegged assets, and its own holdings. At any given moment, we know exactly how much money each of our users is entitled to, and we hold sufficient funds to honor any withdrawal request. And, again, it's all verifiable via the PoR system.""

Most security-minded crypto users would highly recommend withdrawing any funds from an exchange that you don't intend to trade. You can find out why along with other crypto safety best practices in our <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">Crypto Safety Guidelines</a> article.</p><p>Trust Wallet is a fantastic choice for mobile crypto wallets, but if you want the most secure crypto storage wallets available, you may want to check out our article on the <a href=""/analysis/best-hardware-wallets/"">Top Hardware Wallets</a>.</p><p>Regardless of the wallet you choose, always choose a strong password combining letters, capital and lowercase, digits and special characters. If you can opt-in for biometric access, all the better, as nobody has your face or fingerprints.&nbsp;</p><p>When setting up your wallet, write the seed phase somewhere safe and secure. Without this recovery phase, you could permanently lose access to your wallet. (We cover this in detail in the Crypto Safety Guidelines article above)</p><p>2FA might seem a pain when you want to access your wallet fast, but it's extra security for stopping others from fast access to your crypto holdings.&nbsp;</p><h2>Binance Mobile App Security</h2><p>The same rules apply to the <a href=""/review/binance-app-review/"">Binance mobile app</a> as to a crypto wallet. We've all become blasé about using our phones in public and trusting security, but our relaxed approach to trading or buying crypto on mobile apps can be dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>After you download the Binance mobile app, consider the following 8 security tips: -</p><ol><li>Install reputable antivirus protection that offers passcode app locking.</li><li>Update your phone regularly.</li><li>Install a 2FA authenticator such as Google Authenticator or Authy.</li><li>Lock the Binance app if possible.</li><li>Have a lock screen password on your phone, so nobody can access the apps, even if you lose your mobile.</li><li>Consider <a href=""https://go.coinbureau.com/expressvpn"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">installing a VPN</a> for added encrypted security.</li><li>Ideally, don't use the Binance mobile app using public WiFi.</li></ol><p>It might seem a hassle to consider implementing extra security, but protecting your crypto assets is a priority if you want to stay in the crypto market for the long term.</p><h2>Binance vs. Binance US</h2><p>After the United States cracked down on crypto rules and regulations, US regulators classified many Binance assets as ""securities"", part of a financial category including futures, stocks and bonds. As a result, Binance created a US-specific platform for traders and crypto investors based in the United States called <a href=""/review/binance-us-review/"">Binance US</a>.</p><p>Customer support is still 24/7 via email and online chat.</p><p>Although Binance US is available to most states, it is not available to Hawaii, Texas, New York and Vermont. Binance is working to implement compliance requirements globally, as are many cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>Fees, trading, and minimum deposit ($10) are the same, and both platforms support desktop, mobile and web trading.</p><p>Binance US supports USD, EUR and AUD, among others, and over 120 cryptocurrencies. You can read our <a href=""/review/binance-vs-binance-us-review/"">Binance vs. Binance US</a> review for a more detailed comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, besides less liquidity, fewer services, and the method of customer support, Binance and Binance US both prioritise user account security and customer fund security, so the same guidelines apply throughout this article.</p><h2>So, Is Binance Safe?</h2><p>We began this article by asking, ""Is Binance safe?"" Of course, the definition of safe can be subject to individual perspectives. Our objective was to determine if depositing funds with Binance is secure, using the trading platform safely and withdrawing cryptos to your wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, we looked at the security of the Binance mobile wallet and app.</p><p>Whilst we always encourage you to adopt a <a href=""/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/"">responsible approach to securing your digital assets</a>, Binance provides a good selection of tools to help you do so. The peace of mind from knowing Binance has a SAFU in place is a big bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>In November 2022, as the crypto market plunged, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) topped up the Binance SAFU to $1 billion to provide additional security to Binance users during the challenging bear market. In his tweet, Changpeng stated that BNB and BUSD accounted for $700 million and $300 million for the BTC address.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Binance_SAFU_da5619c181.jpg"" alt=""Binance_SAFU.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Binance_SAFU_da5619c181.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Binance_SAFU_da5619c181.jpg 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>In November 2022, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced a SAFU Top Up to $1 Billion: Image Source: <a href=""https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1596024145686716416?lang=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CZ Binance Twitter</a></figcaption></figure><p>In recent years, regulators worldwide have accused Binance of compliance issues and not responding to requests to provide essential information.

Here is a mix of the measures deployed by OKX on the back end and what users can do on the front end to protect their crypto and accounts.</p><h3>OKX Key Security Features</h3><ol style=""list-style-type:decimal;""><li><strong>Offline Storage: </strong>The security program has transparent protocols for protecting user funds. It encompasses the platform, data, assets and access security. Cold wallets are offline and less risky than online wallets (note less risk, not 100% risk-free). OKX takes multiple backups and has storage limits and bank vaults for additional protection. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Online Storage: </strong>Though online wallets are considered riskier than cold wallets, OKX takes essential measures to make them as secure as possible.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OKX Risk Shield:</strong> To safeguard user assets from crypto security risks, OKX continually allocates a percentage of earnings to an asset risk reserve fund.</li><li><strong>Mandatory 2FA: </strong>Many platforms offer two-factor authentication as an option, but OKX make it compulsory for extra security. You can opt-in for an SMS notification or use Google Authenticator.</li><li><strong>Semi-Offline Multi-signatures:</strong> OKX has semi-offline and multiple-signature mechanisms for secure deposits and withdrawals.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Secure Private Key Storage:</strong> OKX stores “private keys in RAM instead of permanent memory.”</li><li><strong>Emergency Backups:</strong> OKX has multiple backup procedures to prepare for potential emergencies fully.</li><li><strong>Anti-Phishing Code:</strong> OKX adds a code to every email you receive. If you do not recognise the code, you know the email is from an illegitimate source.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Another essential security feature is proof-of-reserves. After the shocking <a href=""/newsletters/the-ftx-story-that-blew-my-mind-🤯/"">FTX incident</a> in 2022, many exchanges realised the importance of proving that users' funds were safe. OTX now has Proof of Reserves (PoR) which means it can verify that customer assets correspond to assets held by OTX in reserve.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OKX_proof_of_reserves_ac73534915.jpg"" alt=""OKX_proof-of-reserves.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OKX_proof_of_reserves_ac73534915.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OKX_proof_of_reserves_ac73534915.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_OKX_proof_of_reserves_ac73534915.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_OKX_proof_of_reserves_ac73534915.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>OKX Proof of Reserves Audit Date 19th May 2023: Image Source: OKX</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=""https://www.okx.com/wallet-security"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">OKX Security page</a> provides a deeper dive into the impressive lengths undertaken by the exchange.</p><h2>OKX Wallet Security</h2><p>The <a href=""/review/okx-wallet/"">OKX self-custody wallet</a> is popular with millions of users. You can transfer and secure your digital assets, trade NFTs for free across 11+ networks, swap crypto, and stake supported coins to earn a yield. The earn platform enables you to build a portfolio easily by saving, vaulting, staking, and pooling.&nbsp;</p><p>The user-friendly dashboard enables a ""holistic overview of digital assets, portfolio performance, and transaction history."" In addition, the OKX DEX and Bridge aggregator allows you to swap crypto across more than ten networks, three cross-chain bridges and 100+ DEXs.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't already have an OKX Web3 wallet, create a new one or restore your existing wallet. You can download the extension from Google Chrome or Firefox browser.</p><p>At this stage, you must create a twelve randomly generated word seed phrase, which helps protect your account because you will need it if you ever need to recover it. After that, set a strong password.</p><p>Write down your seed phase somewhere private but where you can access it quickly. After that, select backup to verify the seed phrase. Store the private key securely, and never give that address to anyone, not even your gran.&nbsp;<br><br>Once you have set up your OKX wallet, you can connect it to the mobile app.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>To add extra security to your new OKX wallet, you can choose face ID or fingerprint authentication to log in. Choose a strong password using upper and lower case, digits and special characters and write that down somewhere safe.&nbsp;<br><br>Always double-check a recipient's public wallet address before sending crypto. Avoid logging in to your crypto wallet using public Wi-Fi.&nbsp;<br>One helpful tip is to have several secure wallets so ""all of your crypto eggs"" aren't in one basket.

In addition, the app also allows you to explore the <a href=""/review/okx-nft-marketplace-review/"">OKX NFT marketplace</a>, DeFi and GameFi apps and stake your favourite cryptos.&nbsp;<br><br>Unlike many crypto apps, the OKX mobile app has interactive charts, so you can do technical analysis for cryptos you want to trade or buy. However, a brief warning from someone who traded on a mobile app it's not a great idea. Why? Primarily because it feels too much like a game. Impulsivity takes over, and very soon, you've lost a big chunk of your account funds.

Suppose someone stole your phone. They could open the app and access your account. You could lose all your money.</li><li>I<strong>nstall Network Protection Software:</strong> Many leading security software applications help protect your mobile from other attacks.</li><li><strong>Avoid using Public Wi-Fi: </strong>Never trade on the OKX app using public Wi-Fi in places like coffee shops, trains, airports etc. If hackers are on the same Wi-Fi, it puts your account at risk.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Avoid Cloned and Phishing Sites:</strong> Don't click on a website without the HTTPS protocol. Check the senders' email address because although the external address may look genuine, a deeper dive shows a random spam address. Likewise, please don't click on links in emails unless you are 100% sure it is from a trusted source.</li><li><strong>Use a Strong Password: </strong>It's common sense, but avoid using the same password for all your phone applications. Update your password regularly.</li><li><strong>Don't Share Information With Others: </strong>Not even with those you trust.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><div class=""raw-html-embed""><style type=""text/css"">.code-block-tip blockquote {\n    margin-left: 0;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    padding-left: 30px;\n    line-height: 1.75rem;\n    margin-block-end: 2em;\n    letter-spacing: 0.04em;\n    word-break: break-word;\n    margin-block-start: 0em;\n    border-left: 3px solid yellow;\n}\n.code-block-tip-description-div{\n    font-weignt:800px;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=""code-block-tip"">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=""code-block-tip-description-div""><b>**Pro Tip**</b>&nbsp; You can enhance your online security by encrypting your web traffic and online identity by using a <a href=""https://go.coinbureau.com/expressvpn"" target=""_blank"">strong VPN</a>.

Here are some of the pros of using the OKX App:</p><ol><li><strong>Beautiful Design and Layout</strong></li></ol><p>Okay I know, the aesthetics of a crypto trading app shouldn’t be the first thing on the list, but I’m a sucker for pretty things. I mean, come on, just look at the design. Serious kudos to the design team and artists behind the platform, the app is nearly as nice as the <a href=""/review/exodus-wallet/"">Exodus wallet</a>:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/What_is_OKX_App_3c47144eaa.jpg"" alt=""What is OKX"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_What_is_OKX_App_3c47144eaa.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_What_is_OKX_App_3c47144eaa.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_What_is_OKX_App_3c47144eaa.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_What_is_OKX_App_3c47144eaa.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Image via OKX</figcaption></figure><p>While many of you reading this may not care much for “style points,” I know I would rather use an app packed with eye candy over something that looks like a Nintendo emulator straight out of the year 1998.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>User-friendly interface</strong></li></ul><p>One of the major advantages of the OKX app is its user-friendly interface. The app is well-designed in terms of drop-down menus and icon placement, making it intuitive and easy to navigate. Whether you're a beginner or an <a href=""/trading/basics-of-crypto-trading/"">experienced trader</a>, you will find it fairly straightforward to use the OKX app and find your way around. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and you can download it from the App Store or Google Play.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OKX_user_interface_117fafd0b9.jpg"" alt=""OKX user interface"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OKX_user_interface_117fafd0b9.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OKX_user_interface_117fafd0b9.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_OKX_user_interface_117fafd0b9.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_OKX_user_interface_117fafd0b9.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Image via OKX</figcaption></figure><ul><li><span style=""background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Advanced trading features</strong></li></ul><p>The OKX app comes with a range of advanced trading features that make it possible for traders to manage their portfolios. The app allows you to set stop-loss orders, <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/resources-investors/investor-alerts-bulletins/stop-stop-limits-trading-stop-orders"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">limit orders</a>, and take-profit orders. You can also use the app to trade on <a href=""https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/margin-calls"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">margin</a> and to access a range of trading tools, indicators, and crypto-centric products aside from trading, some of which will be covered later on.&nbsp;</p><p>The range of advanced trading features can also be considered a con for new users, in the interest of full transparency, we will elaborate on this in the next Cons section.</p><ul><li><strong>Wide range of cryptocurrencies</strong></li></ul><p>OKX App supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies (over 200 cryptocurrencies and 400 trading pairs), including <a href=""/education/what-is-bitcoin/"">Bitcoin</a>, Ethereum, Litecoin, and stablecoins. This makes it easy for traders to <a href=""/trading/building-cryptocurrency-portfolio/"">diversify their portfolios</a> and take advantage of different market conditions. The app also supports a huge range of fiat currencies (50+), including USD, EUR, and GBP and more.</p><ul><li><strong>Low fees</strong></li></ul><p>OKX is among the lowest-fee exchanges in the space, offering similar rock-bottom fees competing with the likes of Binance and KuCoin.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Web3 Wallet</strong></li></ul><p><span style=""background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;"">U</span>sers can access and explore the <a href=""/adoption/what-is-web-3-0/"">Web3 universe</a> with the help of the decentralized multi-chain wallet known as OKX Web Wallet. It is a digital wallet that gives users access to over 1,000 DApp protocols and features, including multi-chain and cross-chain DEX, yield farming, NFT marketplace, and DApp discovery, as well as the ability to store any digital assets that are exchanged through the exchange.</p><p>The OKX Web3 wallet is quite an innovation of its own, which is why we have a dedicated <a href=""/review/okx-wallet/"">OKX Web Wallet Review</a> where we explore it in depth.</p><ul><li><strong>KYC Security</strong></li></ul><p>It's important to minimise the risk of fraud on a cryptocurrency exchange. Therefore, all users will need to undergo KYC and identity verification to reach higher limits and certain functions.</p><p>You can find more information about the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.okx.com/academy/en/how-to-kyc-on-okx/#:~:text=OKX%20also%20allows%20users%20to,and%20%24100%2C000%20for%20level%20three."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">OKX KYC levels and limits</a> from their support site.</p><h2>Cons of Using The OKX App</h2><p>While OKX App has many advantages, there are also some drawbacks to using the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some of the cons of using the OKX app:</p><ul><li><strong>Limited payment options</strong></li></ul><p>This is probably the largest drawback to OKX is the fact that there is no fiat offramp, meaning no swapping for fiat and withdrawing to a bank account. If you are needing an exchange with full banking support, I would recommend <a href=""/review/binance/"">Binance</a>, <a href=""/review/kraken/"">Kraken</a>, <a href=""/review/coinbase-pro/"">Coinbase</a>, or <a href=""/review/bitget-exchange-review/"">Bitget</a>.</p><p>Though the fiat support for buying crypto is impressive, a downside is that all crypto purchases are made with a bank card, or through third-party intermediaries, some of which charge higher-than-average fees. Typically, when it comes to exchanges, getting your money onto an exchange is cheapest when the exchange can facilitate direct bank deposits or connections to bank accounts. OKX lacks this feature which is why many crypto users will still use an exchange like Crypto.com, Kraken, or Binance to deposit funds, then simply transfer crypto to OKX to take advantage of the exchange.</p><ul><li><strong>Full-featured platform</strong></li></ul><p>As mentioned in the Pros section, the OKX app has a huge selection of advanced crypto trading products and features available, which can be a double-edged sword.</p><p>While the OKX app is user-friendly and beginners can quickly get the hang of it, the fact that OKX is suitable for advanced traders as well as features a huge range of crypto products means that there are plenty of functions, features, and entire areas of the app that new traders may find overwhelming, making it not the most beginner-friendly crypto trading app.&nbsp;</p><p>The app can feel quite confusing for new users with all sorts of features and settings that many of us will never use. If you are looking for a simple no-frills crypto app, I would recommend <a href=""/review/swissborg-chsb/"">SwissBorg</a> or Kraken as being the most beginner-friendly.</p><p>Fortunately though, to try and combat this, users can easily switch between Lite, Web3, and Pro modes to help make it easier for new users not needing all the bells and whistles.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OKX_pro_5d43a705a5.jpg"" alt=""OKX pro"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OKX_pro_5d43a705a5.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OKX_pro_5d43a705a5.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_OKX_pro_5d43a705a5.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_OKX_pro_5d43a705a5.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Image via OKX</figcaption></figure><h2>User Experience with OKX App</h2><p>The user experience with the OKX app is generally positive among the community according to reviews and Twitter/Reddit statements. After using the app myself, I found the app to be well-designed and easy to navigate. While I don’t typically use mobile apps for frequent trading due to the small screen and lack of additional monitors and research tools, (I go into more detail on why traders don’t use mobile apps in our <a href=""/review/coinbase-pro/"">Coinbase Review</a>), the app does have a suitable range of trading tools and features that make it easier for traders to manage their portfolios on the go.</p><p>I found the app served its purpose well of being able to keep an eye on your portfolio, manage open positions, and for the odd time you do need to place a trade while away from a computer. The app also gives users the ability to:</p><ul><li>Trade Spot, Margin, and <a href=""https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/october-1994/demystifying-derivatives"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Derivatives</a></li><li>Access Lite and Pro versions on the same app</li><li>Buy crypto with card</li><li>Access the P2P exchange</li><li>Access <a href=""/review/okx-earn/"">Earn</a> to benefit from DeFi and earn passive income on your crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>Utilize <a href=""/review/okx-trading-bots/"">OKX Trading Bots</a></li><li>Get crypto insights and alerts on the go</li><li>Use the analysis feature to view the profit and loss (PnL) performance trend for your portfolio over a daily, monthly, or self-selected period. Users can gain insights to help manage investment portfolios in the areas of finance, data analytics, pool mining, and cryptocurrency wallets.</li></ul><p>However, I should mention that some users have reported issues with the app's stability, and trade execution, particularly during times of high trading volume. These complaints are not common and may have had something to do with the trader’s network connection as opposed to the app itself, and I have never personally encountered any connectivity issues.</p><p>I have had issues with frequent redesigns of the apps where certain features and functions have moved or disappeared. One of my favourite features was that there used to be Satoshi giveaways for daily logins and a simple betting feature where you’d bet Satoshis whether you thought the price of BTC would go up or down in the next 24 hours. Those features disappeared without warning, which was a bummer, so I would also warn about not becoming too attached to some functions of the app as they may randomly disappear one day 😡</p><h2>Security Measures of the OKX App</h2><p>OKX takes security seriously, the app has a range of security measures in place to protect users' funds. The app uses two-factor authentication (2FA) and passwords to secure user accounts, takes advantage of mobile biometrics security, and also has a range of other security features, such as SSL encryption and cold storage for user funds.</p><p>The OKX approach to security and cold storage solutions is actually one of the most robust I’ve seen in the industry and I have long been impressed by the security measures and protocols in place. I won’t go into detail here as we cover it in our dedicated <a href=""/review/okx/"">OKX review</a>. You can also take a look at their multi-pronged approach to security on their&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.okx.com/wallet-security"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Security Page</a>.</p><h2>Comparison with Other Trading Apps</h2><p>Compared to other cryptocurrency trading apps, the OKX app has some advantages and disadvantages. When compared to Coinbase, the OKX app has a far wider range of cryptocurrencies and more advanced trading features. However, Coinbase has better customer support, benefits from a stronger reputation, is regulated, and is more beginner friendly.&nbsp;</p><p>A note on Coinbase though, it is great for beginners, but I have found it quite common for many traders to “outgrow” Coinbase and move onto an exchange such as OKX, <a href=""/review/bitget-exchange-review/"">Bitget</a>, or Binance to access the lower fees and more trading functionality, as well as a better selection of crypto products like staking, earn, crypto borrowing, lending, and more.</p><p>When compared to Binance, the OKX app has better security measures and access to the Web3 Wallet, but Binance has a wider range of payment options and better fiat on and off-ramp support. You can learn more about Binance and why it is crowed as “The King of Exchanges” in our <a href=""/review/binance/"">Binance review</a>.</p><p>The comparison to SwissBorg is an easy one, as these two are cut from a very different cloth. SwissBorg might be the easiest to use and one of the most unique crypto apps around. SwissBorg is not suitable for trading with technical analysis, as there is no charting functionality, but the platform aggregates low-fee swaps from many leading exchanges to provide users with simple one-click trading. SwissBorg is also more of a crypto wealth management platform as opposed to a trading exchange like OKX. You can learn more about it in our <a href=""/review/swissborg-chsb/"">SwissBorg review</a>.</p><h2>Customer Support of the OKX App</h2><p>OKX app customer support is pretty good, not great, not bad. Some users report slow response times, though I cannot say I found the support times too terrible. I have used OKX in the past and found their support to be adequate, and for the purpose of this review, I tested their support response times over a span of 3 days, messaging in at different times of the day with a mix of simple and complex answers.</p><p><a href=""https://guy.coinbureau.com/signup/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg"" alt=""Newsletter Inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Newsletter_inline_a4c7553089.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><p>I found I received responses within a minute or two in most cases, with some of the more complex questions taking over ten minutes so they could track down the answer. The quality of the support wasn’t great as it was mostly just generic responses and links to the self-help section. The support wasn’t “wow-worthy” like with exchanges such as Kraken, but if I were grading it, I’d give it a solid B minus.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Get Started With the OKX App</h2><p>Getting started with the OKX app is easy. Simply download the app from the App Store or Google Play, and create an account. OKX require KYC for all trading levels, but if you already have an OKX account for the web platform, you will be able to log in with those details and not need to go through KYC again.</p><p>Once you've done that, you can start buying and selling cryptocurrencies on the app. Here are those steps broken down:</p><ol style=""list-style-type:decimal;""><li>First thing you will need to do is&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.okx.com/activities/blastoff-coin-bureau-exclusive?channelid=15178378"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">create an account</a>.

These fees can be made even lower depending on tier level which is determined by 30-day trading volume and asset/OKX token holdings. Here is a look at the OKX fee structure to give you an overview of trading fees:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/OKX_Fees_4383e27111.jpg"" alt=""OKX Fees"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_OKX_Fees_4383e27111.jpg 240w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_OKX_Fees_4383e27111.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_OKX_Fees_4383e27111.jpg 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_OKX_Fees_4383e27111.jpg 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Image via OKX</figcaption></figure><h2>OKX App Review: Final Verdict</h2><div class=""raw-html-embed""><blockquote>\n\n<p>Overall, the OKX App is a reliable, highly functional, and secure cryptocurrency trading platform with a range of advanced trading features and crypto products. The app is well-designed and easy to use, and it supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

The CEO, Justin Sun, initially deployed TRX tokens (ERC-20) on the <a href=""https://ethereum.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum</a> network but later moved away. It was probably a decision that determined the success of the project.</p><figure class=""image image_resized"" style=""width:75%;""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/justin_sun_e243566f4e_1a4d008de7.webp"" alt=""justin_sun_e243566f4e.webp"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_justin_sun_e243566f4e_1a4d008de7.webp 156w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Justin Sun, Tron CEO and a 30 under 30 Entrepreneur: Image Source Forbes</figcaption></figure><p>The Tron Foundation launched the project intending to give ownership rights to content creators, notably for digital content. Content creators can connect directly with their audience, which allows them to maximise and monetise content more efficiently.</p><p>If we consider how we stream content via the leading tech giants, it's an unfair system. For example, YouTube can randomly decide to close a user's account and choose to censor certain content while promoting others.</p><p>Facebook can decrease reach or, worse, ban the content creator from posting or commenting in their group. Come on, Mark Zuckerberg, do you genuinely think your big-boy micromanaging approach is fair to your users?&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is we do not own our content. Content creators, like musicians, struggle to make a living when the streaming tech giants like Spotify and Apple stomp all over uploaded content with an ""<i>it's mine now""&nbsp;</i>attitude. They pay content creators a few peanuts for their work whilst they make the lion's share for doing, well, not much at all, other than being ""big.""&nbsp;</p><p>You know what I am talking about.</p><p>For this reason, Tron sought to become a disruptor in an unbalanced playing field. You, me, and content creators worldwide should be glad about that, and the tech giants should watch their backs and not rest on their considerable laurels.</p><h3>What is the TRON Network</h3><p>Tron supports <a href=""/analysis/best-tron-dapps/"">dApps</a>, smart contracts and numerous blockchain systems. It uses the <a href=""https://blockonomi.com/utxo-vs-account-based-transaction-models/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">account-based</a> model , a transaction model similar to <a href=""/education/what-is-ethereum"">Ethereum</a>, with a transparent public ledger for anyone to track transaction history. Anyone can build and develop dApps on the Tron network, and if users provide and share their content, Tron rewards them with digital assets.</p><p>The TRON ecosystem includes a blockchain explorer, lending platforms, DEXes, wallets, and even a decentralised oracle.</p><p>Many of the talent team on Tron are highly experienced individuals from projects such as <a href=""/press-release/brd-strategic-partnership-ripple/"">Ripple</a> Labs.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>""Since TRON DAO was founded, it has upheld its original faith of decentralizing the Internet, working hard to change the world with technology."" (Source: Tron)</p></blockquote><h3>What is Tron's Technology?</h3><p>Tron adapts a 3-layer architecture divided into Storage Layer, Core Layer, and Application Layer. The TRON protocol adheres to Google Protobuf, which intrinsically supports the multi-language extension.

Tron users vote for “super representatives” (SRs) who earn fees by validating network transactions. Due to the decentralised nature, the Tron users have governance on the network, and nobody has control over more than one network node.</p><p><strong>Tron uses a 3-layer architecture: -</strong></p><ol><li>Core</li><li>Storage</li><li>Application</li></ol><p>This architecture helps reduce the typical latency associated with more conventional networks and the high transaction costs.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/TVM_workflow_37773ddd6c.jpg"" alt=""TVM_workflow.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_TVM_workflow_37773ddd6c.jpg 144w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_TVM_workflow_37773ddd6c.jpg 461w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Tron's TVM Workflow: Image Source Tron <a href=""https://tron.network/static/doc/white_paper_v_2_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Whitepaper</a></figcaption></figure><h2>What is Tron (TRX)?</h2><p>The Tron (TRX) token is for rewarding users for creating and sharing content such as music, videos and photos. TRX is also used for online gaming as a currency, for powering lending platforms and decentralised exchanges.</p><p>Tron is an open-source project using permissionless protocols and tools to deliver global content to its users and, additionally, TRX is used for smart contract-based financial projects.</p><p>TRX holders have governance on the network.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tron’s Periander Upgrade</h3><p>In July 2023, Tron released Great Voyage v4.7.2 (Periander), an upgraded version of its mainnet. The upgrade introduced significant improvements in four areas:</p><p><strong>Advanced stake 2.0 mechanism</strong></p><p>Two important governance proposals for TRON stake 2.0 are part of the upgrade. The first proposal allows users to withdraw their unstaking requests that are still in progress. The second proposal empowers users to customize the lockup period for delegated resources according to their individual needs.</p><p><strong>Compatibility with Ethereum's EIP-3855</strong></p><p>This new governance proposal ensures the compatibility between Tron and Ethereum's virtual machines while reducing the associated costs to deploy and use smart contracts on the Tron network. The company hopes this will attract more developers to and promote enhanced interoperability between Tron and Ethereum ecosystems.</p><p><strong>Streamlined smart contract interface calling</strong></p><p>As part of this upgrade, Tron has optimized triggersmartcontract and triggerconstantcontract, two interfaces for calling smart contracts, to provide developers with estimated transaction fees for deploying their contracts. Tron said this paves the way for the creation of more high-quality DApps.</p><p><strong>Revamped P2P network module</strong></p><p>Four key functionalities were introduced:</p><ul><li>The upgraded network now incorporates a pre-detection mechanism for nodes pending connection to filter out invalid connection requests.</li><li>The implementation of the DNS protocol improves the platform's availability by enabling the discovery of active nodes that are ready to connect to the Tron network.</li><li>The network now supports the IPv6 protocol, a crucial development that enhances the scalability of Java-tron's network architecture in the future.</li><li>The introduction of message compression before transmission reduces the bandwidth requirements for Java-tron, leading to lower operational and maintenance costs.</li></ul><h2>How Do You Get Free Tron (TRX) Transaction Fees?</h2><p>Are Tron (TRX) transaction fees really free? Well, they can be.</p><blockquote><p>""TRON network generally does not charge fees for most transactions; however, due to system restrictions and fairness, bandwidth usage and transactions do take in certain fees."" (Source: Tron)</p></blockquote><ol><li>Tron issues 5,000 FREE bandwidth points daily to users. You can freeze TRX to get more bandwidth points if you need more. The amount of TRX required is the number of bytes (10 SUN: 1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN: <i>See below for an explanation of&nbsp;</i>SUN).</li><li>Smart contracts use ""energy"" and require bandwidth points for broadcasting and confirming transactions.</li><li>Query transactions are FREE, as no energy or bandwidth is required.</li></ol><p>TRON network also defines a set of fixed fees for the following transactions:</p><ul style=""list-style-type:disc;""><li>Creating a witness node: 9999 TRX</li><li>Issuing a TRC-10 token: 1024 TRX</li><li>Creating a new account: 0.1 TRX</li><li>Creating an exchange pair: 1024 TRX</li></ul><p>(Source: Tron <a href=""https://tron.network/static/doc/white_paper_v_2_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Whitepaper</a>)</p><p>Tron (TRX) transactions are exceptionally low compared to other crypto networks. For example, you could pay hundreds of dollars in transaction fees on the <a href=""https://ethereum.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum</a> (ETH) network.</p><h3>What is The Sun Network?</h3><blockquote><p>""SUN's main purpose is to exist as support for the TRON protocol, which aims to create a decentralized internet ecosystem. SUN specifically focuses on DeFi and aiding its uptake and infiltration on TRON's blockchain."" (Source: CoinMarketCap)</p></blockquote><h2>TRX Price and Potential</h2><p>You would have been hiding under a rock not to know we've been in a crypto bear market for a good while.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2022, Tron (TRX) was at a high of $0.0806 when it suddenly dropped below $0.0602. Since then, it's been a bit of a rocky road. The lowest price was $0.05 in November 2022, and it's been a steady ascent since then.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/tron_price_chart_663203e9be.jpg"" alt=""tron_price_chart.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_tron_price_chart_663203e9be.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_tron_price_chart_663203e9be.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_tron_price_chart_663203e9be.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Tron (TRX) Price Chart From June 2022 to May 2023: Image Source <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CoinMarketCap</a></figcaption></figure><p>Crypto ""experts"" predict the Tron (TRX) price could be as high as $0.14 by the end of 2023. However, the crypto market moves in a swarm pattern, so Tron (TRX) price will greatly depend on whether the bear market moves aside for the bulls.&nbsp;</p><p>In early 2018, Tron (TRX) spiked to an all-time high of just under $0.21. Many investors believe in the potential of the Tron project and support TRX (Remember, Tron has 161 million users). Tron still has a lot of work to do, but the signs are positive for the future of the project and the TRX token.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial experts suggest that bear markets typically last two years or more, and we're about at that point. Other experts suggest that the crypto market correlates with the stock market. However, with a collapsing world economy, nobody can genuinely (or accurately) predict how things might go.&nbsp;</p><h3>How to Buy Tron Cryptocurrency</h3><p>TRX is listed on 130+ <a href=""/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/"">cryptocurrency </a>exchanges worldwide, including the majors like <a href=""/review/binance/"">Binance</a>, <a href=""/review/okx/"">OKX</a>, and <a href=""/review/bitget-exchange-review/"">Bitget</a>.

Low fees and fast transactions are always welcome when many projects are expensive and slow. For developers, the Tron network is ideal for creating smart contracts for diverse applications.&nbsp;</p><p>It's tricky to assume that Tron is a unique project with a mass of potential, but, to date, the network has proved to be popular with users, developers and projects.</p><p>Tron (TRX) has a market cap of almost $7 billion and a trading volume of over $200 million. That's not small fry. Bitcoin has a market cap of over $500 billion, and Ethereum is $200+ billion, but they are at the summit of the crypto pile.</p><p><a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CoinMarketCap</a> ranks Tron (TRX) in the top twelve listed cryptocurrencies. That's quite an accolade considering there are over 24,500 cryptocurrencies listed. Add to that fast speeds, scalability and high availability, and you have a crypto project with a good chance of continued success.</p><blockquote><p>""DAppChain, sidechain of TRON: DAppChain is TRON's sidechain project. The goal is to help DApps to operate on TRON with lower energy consumption, faster speed and enhanced safety, providing unlimited capacity for TRON's main network."" (Source: Tron)</p></blockquote><p>Only time will tell if Tron (TRX) lives up to its loyal followers' expectations. As we traverse out of the bear market, that will be the ideal time to see how Tron (TRX) performs. If the project can gain more market capitalisation, there is scope for it to move higher in CoinMarketCap's cryptocurrency ranking.&nbsp;</p>"https://www.coinbureau.com/Review/gemini-vs-kraken/,Gemini Vs Kraken: Which is the Best Cryptocurrency Exchange? (2023),Review,"<p>When you're new to <a href=""/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/"">cryptocurrencies</a>, one of the biggest challenges you face is choosing a cryptocurrency exchange you can trust. Of course, every crypto enthusiast has their favourites, usually based on personal experience. Still, the essential component is whether an exchange offers the security, products, and services you need. In addition, a record of customer service should also count in your decision.</p><p><a href=""/review/gemini"">Gemini </a>and Kraken are reputable, established, USA-based cryptocurrency exchanges. Gemini began in 2014. The Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, opened the launch with a determined focus on security first and quickly became one of the most regulated and compliant crypto exchanges worldwide.</p><p><a href=""/review/kraken"">Kraken</a> is one of the largest crypto exchanges popular with beginners, advanced traders, and investors. Established in 2011 by Jesse Powell and owned by Payward.Inc, Kraken was among the first to offer users access to derivatives, spot trading and index products.</p><p>In this Gemini vs Kraken article, we will look at two of the top cryptocurrency exchanges suitable for all levels of investors and traders. Hopefully, you will soon know if either of these companies is right for you.</p><p>We intend to look at each exchange individually, but below is a quick overview of our findings by comparing Gemini and Kraken.</p><h2>Gemini vs Kraken: Products Offered</h2><h3>Gemini Products</h3><p>Gemini has an excellent range of services that appeal to all levels of traders and investors.</p><ul><li><strong>Web Trader: </strong>A beginner-friendly platform for retail traders. It's an easy interface to navigate if you're just starting in crypto trading</li><li><strong>ActiveTrader:</strong> Once you have some trading experience under your belt, Active Trader is the next step. You must request access to this service. Once you have permission, you can place the following orders:&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Limit Order: </strong>A pre-placed buy or sell order to execute at a predetermined price.</li><li><strong>Market Order: </strong>An immediate live buy or sell order to the market.</li><li><strong>Maker-or-Cancel:</strong> An order executed (only) if it gets you the ""maker"" fee.</li><li><strong>Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC):</strong> It will execute part or all of your order.</li><li><strong>Fill-or-Kill (FOC): </strong>Immediate order execution. You cannot do partial orders</li></ul></li><li><strong>Auction</strong>: A daily auction (inc holidays and weekends) for Gemini's listed cryptocurrencies. To engage, switch to ""Daily Auction"" from the ActiveTrader interface.</li><li><strong>Block Trade: </strong>Liquidity can be affected by large orders coming into the market, which can cause slippage issues. Placing a block trade order is like an OTC (over-the-counter) service.</li><li><strong>Gemini Earn: </strong>Earn a small yield from your crypto whilst you aren't using it. The small interest rates won't pay the mortgage, but every bit helps, right?</li><li><strong>Gemini Clearing: </strong>This service enables two parties to trade directly and anonymously. Gemini acts as a trusted third party.</li><li><strong>Gemini Mobile: </strong>You can use the mobile app (for iOS and Android) with Web Trader but not ActiveTrader.</li></ul><p>So, I'm sure you will agree that <a href=""/review/gemini"">Gemini&nbsp;</a>has an impressive product range, so now let's look at Krakens products.</p><p><a href=""/deals/wallet/unstoppable-domains/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg"" alt=""Unstoppable Domains Inline"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Unstoppable_Domains_Inline_f1d93210d7.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""></a></p><h3>Kraken Products</h3><p>After registration and account verification, you can access Kraken via the web platform or, if you prefer, download the Kraken app (available for Android and iOS).</p><ul><li><strong>Staking: </strong>No matter what's happening in the crypto market, you can earn up to 23% with popular PoS (<a href=""/analysis/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/"">proof-of-stake</a>) crypto assets listed with Kraken.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Crypto Education:</strong> Kraken Learn is a superb service to help educate you on everything crypto. The video, webinars, crypto guides, and podcasts provide in-depth information and can only help you learn how to maximise your financial understanding of cryptocurrencies.</li><li><strong>Kraken App: </strong>Kraken has two mobile apps. One is for advanced trading, and the other is for day-to-day trading and hodling.<ul><li><strong>Kraken Pro: </strong>This app has an easy and attractive interface. It is super easy to navigate, even for beginners. You can execute, monitor and adjust trades on the go.</li><li><strong>Kraken App: </strong>With over 1M downloads, the Kraken app is popular with users for tracking, converting, buying, and selling cryptocurrencies listed with Kraken. It has low fees, exceptional security (biometric &amp; password protected), 24/7 support, and multiple payment options.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kraken Pro:</strong> For more advanced traders, the Kraken Pro platform offers lower fees than the standard platform, more suitable for beginners. You gain access to more order types, charting, and tools for advanced trading.</li></ul><p>Kraken may not have as many products as Gemini, but it has an excellent reputation for providing a good service for its users and is often considered the most secure exchange in the industry.</p><h2>Gemini vs Kraken: User Friendliness</h2><p>In the early days, navigating the user interface on most cryptocurrency exchanges was like dropping an alien in the middle of London and asking it to find a specific street (from over 40,000). Buying, selling and <a href=""/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/"">trading cryptocurrencies </a>was so complex it repelled many new users from adopting cryptocurrencies and changing their finances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Thankfully, times have changed. Gemini and Kraken are user-friendly with easy-to-navigate interfaces. Still, are there differences between the two, and if so, what are they?</p><p>Gemini and Kraken have iOS and Android mobile apps for trading and managing your crypto portfolio. Of the two, Gemini has the slight advantage of user-friendliness, as it is a bit easier for beginners to navigate the interface. In addition, the AutoTrader option is ideal for more advanced traders. Gemini also has multiple guides to help support crypto newbies.</p><p><a href=""/review/kraken"">Kraken</a> is a user-friendly platform but leans slightly towards a more advanced user, especially with Kraken Pro. It's not quite as intuitive as Gemini's interface. However, finding your way around Kraken's website and trading platforms is not challenging once you familiarise yourself with how it works.</p><p>Both crypto exchanges are suitable for all levels of traders and investors. Still, if you are new to cryptocurrency exchanges, anticipate a bit more of a learning curve with Kraken.</p><h2>Gemini vs Kraken: Fees</h2><p>Both Kraken and Gemini have competitive fees. Though the breakdown can seem a little complex, it isn't once you understand how the fee structure works.</p><h3>Deposit and Withdrawal Fees</h3><p>You can deposit most fiat currencies for free with Kraken. Withdrawal fees vary depending on what currency you are withdrawing. There is a minimum withdrawal fee and a flat fee for transactions when moving your funds from your Kraken account.</p><p>Deposit fees for Kraken are variable, but some crypto deposits incur variable on-chain costs, such as <a href=""https://ethereum.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum </a>and Ethereum Classic. Terra Classic and TerraUSD Classic deposits incur a 0.2% tax burn.</p><p>Wire deposits and bank transfers are free with <a href=""/review/gemini"">Gemini</a>, but check transfer fees from your bank. You can deposit with a debit or credit card with fiat currencies, but there is a 3.49% fee, and this service is not available to United States users.</p><p>Each month, Gemini allows you to have up to ten crypto withdrawals for free, which you cannot roll over into the next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Trading Fees</p><p>Both exchanges base fee structures on 30-day trading volume at variable levels.</p><h3>Gemini Web &amp; Mobile Trading Fees (Standard)</h3><ul><li>Less than $10.00 = $0.99&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>$10.00 to less than $25.00 = $1.49&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>$25.00 to less than $50.00 = $1.99&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>$50.00 to less than $200 = $2.99&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>$200+ = 1.49% of the order value</li></ul><h3>Gemini Maker &amp; Taker &amp; Fees</h3><figure class=""table""><table><tbody><tr><td>30-Day Volume Maker Taker</td><td>Maker</td><td>Taker</td></tr><tr><td>$0&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;0.40%&nbsp;</td><td>0.20%</td></tr><tr><td>$10,000</td><td>0.30%</td><td>&nbsp; 0.10%</td></tr><tr><td>$50,000</td><td>0.25%</td><td>&nbsp; 0.10%</td></tr><tr><td>$100,000</td><td>&nbsp;0.20%</td><td>&nbsp;0.08%</td></tr><tr><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;</td><td>0.15%</td><td>&nbsp;0.05%</td></tr><tr><td>$5,000,000</td><td>&nbsp;0.10%</td><td>&nbsp;0.03%</td></tr><tr><td>$10,000</td><td>&nbsp;0.08%</td><td>0.02%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><br>Kraken Maker &amp; Taker Fees</h3><blockquote><p><i>""Kraken fees for buying, selling, or converting assets using Instant Buy consists of a displayed fee and, where applicable, a spread which is included in the price.

They take it very seriously indeed. From asset protection, user account management, internal control, and compliance, Gemini stands above many leading crypto exchanges for its attention to security.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/shutterstock_2122606175_13831fca25.jpg"" alt=""Gemini Takes Security Seriously"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_shutterstock_2122606175_13831fca25.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_shutterstock_2122606175_13831fca25.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_shutterstock_2122606175_13831fca25.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption>Gemini Prioritises Account Security.

The Winklevoss twins famously claimed that Facebook was their idea, resulting in a $65 million settlement. This incident led to the movie ""<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Social Network</a>."" Interestingly, all three were Harvard University students at the time.</p><p>The Gemini platform offers a tiered service catering to casual investors and hardcore traders, with separate interfaces and fee structures.

In the realm of Web3 gaming, X-talk enables cross-chain interoperability. This means gamers can easily move their in-game items and progress between different games and blockchains. For example, imagine a scenario where a player accumulates rare items and achievements in one blockchain-based game. With X-talk, they can easily transfer those assets to another game running on a different blockchain. This expands the utility and value of their digital possessions and delivers a better gaming experience. It also encourages collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas among game developers and communities.</p><p>For decentralized finance (De-Fi), X-talk connects fragmented protocols and blockchains. This will unlock a new level of efficiency and liquidity. With X-talk, users can seamlessly transfer their assets and liquidity between different De-Fi platforms operating on separate blockchains. Users can leverage the advantages of various protocols and access a wider range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>X-talk creates a unified and interoperable ecosystem, while also eliminating the need for complicated and risky token swaps and reliance on bridges. This makes it easier for users to navigate and take part in the expanding De-Fi landscape.</p><p>X-talk may be the catalyst that propels blockchain technology towards its true potential. By connecting fractured ecosystems, it can unlock nearly limitless new possibilities.

It has two responsibilities: monitor the Bitcoin network to ensure the funds’ safety, and perform transactions by communicating with other nodes. It keeps tabs on which channel has how much so that there will be enough to make a payment when the need arises.</p><p><strong>Channels </strong>– Channels are how two parties pay each other. Each party opens a channel on a node by depositing some BTC in it. Think of a channel like the sender and receiver. They need to know who is on the other end making and receiving the payment. How the payment is made is the node’s business. It can be a direct payment between two nodes, or it could involve multiple nodes along the way.</p><p>Both the opening and closing of channels are recorded on the Bitcoin network.

It enables fast and cheap transactions on Bitcoin through the use of channels and Lightning nodes.</p><p>There are two types of wallets catering to different types of users.</p><h3><strong>Custodial Wallets</strong></h3><p>When you use a custodial wallet, your funds are parked with the custodian. As a result, you will need to trust that they won’t run away with your money or mismanage the business. On the other hand, you do not have the responsibility of safeguarding your own funds. When you want to send a payment, the wallet routes the funds on your behalf and shows you the balance you have with them. However, there’s no way for you to verify if the balance you see is true unless you move your funds to a non-custodial wallet through the Bitcoin network.</p><p>In return for your trust, custodial wallets take care of the node-running and channel management part for the user. All they need to do is follow the simple UI to send and receive funds. All the complicated stuff is handled by the wallet. In some cases, if two customers use the same app to send funds to each other, a channel is not needed as the wallet can shuffle the funds from one party to another using their system. You can also receive BTC via Lightning without having to first provide liquidity to activate the channel.</p><h3><strong>Non-Custodial Wallets</strong></h3><p>Security is solely on the user’s shoulders if they choose to go with a non-custodial wallet. Those who like to have complete control over their funds consider this a blessing as they do not have to trust a third party with their precious BTC.</p><p>Each non-custodial wallet has its own node. Some offer the option for users to connect to their node of choice instead of using the wallet’s node. Aside from that, other related operations such as channel management, including the opening and closing of channels, channel capacity etc can be handled by the non-custodial wallet for those who do not want to muck around. Certain wallets offer advanced users the ability to fiddle with channel-related settings.</p><p>One thing they will have to consider is how much BTC to allocate when opening a channel. This is because there needs to be a minimum amount of sats to keep the channel open, especially if it will be open for an extended period of time, like a running tab at a restaurant or your neighbourhood Quik-E Mart where you only settle the bill once a month.</p><p>If you are going to be using any non-custodial wallets for cryptocurrencies, I recommend checking out our article on <a href=""https://www.coinbureau.com/education/crypto-safety-protect-crypto/""><strong>crypto safety</strong></a> to ensure you are following the best practices to keep your crypto safe!</p><h2><strong>How Do Lightning Wallets Work?</strong></h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Bitcoin has a <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8946216"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>scaling problem</strong></a>. This makes it a less-than-ideal choice for a global payment system despite the super-tight security and value-retaining features. It wasn’t until the emergence of the <a href=""https://dci.mit.edu/lightning-network"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>, introduced by Thaddeus Dryjo and Joseph Poon in a white paper, that gave Bitcoin a shot at overcoming the issue of scalability.</p><p>The Lightning Network allows Bitcoin micropayments to happen off-chain through nodes and channels, similar to a sidechain for Ethereum. These micropayments are made instantly and save a lot on transaction costs, compared to the main Bitcoin network. Transactions that happen on the Lightning Network are not recorded on the main Bitcoin network except for the opening and closing of channels as these transactions carry the BTC balances needed to keep track of the overall balance. It’s like having a fixed amount for a monthly food budget but you may not track every single penny spent for food.</p><p>A Bitcoin Lightning wallet usually is its own Lightning node where it allows payments to be routed through it to other nodes/destinations. At the same time, it also enables channels to be opened and to be the party initiating the transaction to someone else.</p><p>The job of each Lightning node is to route payments. The compensation they get is the fees set by the node operators. In order to be a successful node operator, a certain amount of capital is required as liquidity. Insufficient liquidity from the nodes means that the payments will fail, and node operators won’t get any compensation.</p><p>To maintain the balance of funds in a node, you want to have almost equal amounts of inbound and outbound payments so that the funds in the node do not get depleted from making too many payments but not enough paid to you. Here is where fees come in.</p><p>There are two types of fees: the ones charged by the network and by the wallet. The amount of fees charged, denominated in sats, may not appear to be a lot in cash terms, but as the price of Bitcoin rises, there would be a significant difference between 120 sats and 12,000 sats. The fees charged include channel management and making a transaction or payment.</p><p>Aside from payments, the wallet also gives the users access to apps or locations where they can use their sats. This encourages more people to consider using Bitcoin for their daily needs.</p><h2><strong>Best Bitcoin Lightning Wallets</strong></h2><p>In the following section, we will introduce a number of wallets, both custodial and non-custodial ones, for your consideration. Bearing in mind that the context is around ease of making payments in everyday situations, the focus is on mobile apps as most of us have accepted using some kind of e-wallet on our phones to pay for things.</p><h3><strong>Wallet of Satoshi</strong></h3><p>The official website of <a href=""https://walletofsatoshi.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Wallet of Satoshi</strong></a> claims that it’s “the world’s simplest Bitcoin Lightning wallet” and it does appear so. This Lightning wallet is the custodial type that is only available on mobile for both Android and iOS users.</p><p>After downloading the app to your phone, you are greeted with a screen with the Send and Receive button, allowing you to instantly send or receive Bitcoin. For the full menu list, select the three lines in the top-right corner. Enter an email address to use the account on multiple devices.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/The_various_layouts_of_the_app_Image_via_Wallet_Of_Satoshi_33d04b03a1.png"" alt=""The various layouts of the app Satoshi Wallet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_The_various_layouts_of_the_app_Image_via_Wallet_Of_Satoshi_33d04b03a1.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_The_various_layouts_of_the_app_Image_via_Wallet_Of_Satoshi_33d04b03a1.png 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>The various layouts of the app. Image via WalletOfSatoshi</i></figcaption></figure><p>The wallet offers three ways to add funds to it: receiving Bitcoin from another wallet via the main Bitcoin network, Lightning Network, and buying Bitcoin directly from them. Moonpay is the partner for buying and selling Bitcoin through the app. Prior to entering your card details, you get an email notification with the verification code through the email address you entered for creating an account. Note that this is subject to the regions supported by Moonpay.</p><p>If you’re at a loss as to where you can spend your Bitcoin, the app links you up with <a href=""https://btcmap.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>btcmap.org&nbsp;</strong></a> which lets you know which vendors or ATMs in your area accept Bitcoin as payment. In terms of security, the app has a biometric setting and the ability to hide your balance.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Menu_and_Setting_options_Image_via_Wallet_of_Satoshi_f290f35c68.png"" alt=""Menu and Setting options Satoshi Wallet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Menu_and_Setting_options_Image_via_Wallet_of_Satoshi_f290f35c68.png 190w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Menu_and_Setting_options_Image_via_Wallet_of_Satoshi_f290f35c68.png 500w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Menu and Setting options.

It’s been around since 2011 and is used by many of the Bitcoin OGs. Security is one of the great features of the wallet because it has a watching-only wallet function for tracking transactions, multisig abilities, and supports hardware wallets that were introduced by Guy in his <a href=""https://www.coinbureau.com/videos/top-5-best-hardware-wallets-which-are-the-safest/""><strong>Top 5 Hardware Wallets</strong></a> video. The wallet features both a desktop and mobile version (but only for Android), making it handy for mobile users to make payments to merchants.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Configure_Electrum_for_Lightning_Payments_Image_via_Electrum_Google_Playstore_82578a5d10.png"" alt=""Configure Electrum for Lightning Payments"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Configure_Electrum_for_Lightning_Payments_Image_via_Electrum_Google_Playstore_82578a5d10.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Configure_Electrum_for_Lightning_Payments_Image_via_Electrum_Google_Playstore_82578a5d10.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Configure_Electrum_for_Lightning_Payments_Image_via_Electrum_Google_Playstore_82578a5d10.png 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Configure Electrum for Lightning Payments. Image via Electrum Google Playstore</i></figcaption></figure><p>Electrum is also the oldest wallet to adopt Lightning network payments since they announced their support in 2020. The wallet itself is open-source and free to download. However, it is not a wallet for newbies as there are many options to configure the wallet to do a lot of things. However, it is great for those who want as complete control as possible over their wallet setup.</p><h3><strong>Breez Mobile</strong></h3><p>Breez Mobile is a non-custodial open-source wallet available in iOS and Android for Lightning payments. By using Breez, you are essentially running your own Lightning node on your mobile. You will also need to open a channel with Breez and have a minimum of around 600 sats in your balance to keep this wallet active.</p><p>To add funds to the wallet, you can make a BTC deposit from another address, buy Bitcoin, or use a FastBitcoins voucher. Note that both the actions of adding and removing funds involve interacting with the main Bitcoin network.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Breez_Mobile_Wallet_1024x545_e201a5712f.png"" alt=""Breez Mobile Wallet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Breez_Mobile_Wallet_1024x545_e201a5712f.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Breez_Mobile_Wallet_1024x545_e201a5712f.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Breez_Mobile_Wallet_1024x545_e201a5712f.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Breez_Mobile_Wallet_1024x545_e201a5712f.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Use Breez for P2P payments, accept BTC for services, or support your favorite podcaster. Image via Breez Google Playstore</i></figcaption></figure><p>The wallet can be backed up to a cloud storage such as Google Drive so it’s not great for anonymity or if you want to divest yourself from the clutches of a big tech company. For extra protection, add a 12-word phrase during the backup process. That being said, it also lets you restore your wallet using your Google account. Note that the wallet is still in Beta mode so please use at your own risk.</p><p>What makes Breez interesting is that it’s not just a mobile wallet. It can also double as a Point-of-Sale app for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin for their products and services. In addition, you can also listen to podcasts on the app and support your favorite podcasters by paying them in sats. This is possible by giving them a “boost” with a one-time payment or entering an amount for Sats/minute, basically, pay as you listen.</p><h3><strong>Zap Wallet</strong></h3><p><a href=""https://zaphq.io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Zap wallet</strong></a> is the brainchild of <a href=""https://twitter.com/jackmallers"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Jack Mallers</strong></a>, known for the Strike app, a payment network for merchants used by Shopify. He was one of the first to publicly preach the gospel of the Lightning Network to the masses. The non-custodial wallet, in both desktop (MacOS, Windows, Linux!) and mobile versions, is more suited for medium to advanced users. Some setup is required to get the wallet up and running. Jack has made <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2XDt7iKE7A&amp;list=PLMj6UA3-f3cQq_TjCXAAeP1mmRnjgnDrI"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>some YouTube tutorials</strong></a> on this topic and a few more. Note that the mobile versions do not contain a Lightning node and require a separate node to use it.</p><p>You can connect the wallet to an existing node prior to opening a channel there. Future features include the ability to run a full Lightning node in one click and use the Tor network to connect, thus maximizing anonymity and security, plus the ability to buy Bitcoin directly from the app.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Zap_Wallet_requires_some_setup_Image_via_Zap_Wallet_Google_Playstore_d6d87d9108.png"" alt=""Zap Wallet requires some setup"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Zap_Wallet_requires_some_setup_Image_via_Zap_Wallet_Google_Playstore_d6d87d9108.png 242w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Zap_Wallet_requires_some_setup_Image_via_Zap_Wallet_Google_Playstore_d6d87d9108.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Zap_Wallet_requires_some_setup_Image_via_Zap_Wallet_Google_Playstore_d6d87d9108.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Zap_Wallet_requires_some_setup_Image_via_Zap_Wallet_Google_Playstore_d6d87d9108.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Zap Wallet requires some setup.

In situations where you need to pay someone but you don’t have a direct channel with that person, the funds will then go through a swap provider who helps you pass along the funds to the intended party. The swap provider sends the funds to the recipient first, then claims the same amount from the sender by the revelation of a secret created by the recipient within a certain timeframe.</li></ul><h3><strong>Phoenix wallet</strong></h3><p>ACINQ, one of the teams that contribute to the development of the Lightning network and created the Eclair wallet, has released another product called <a href=""https://phoenix.acinq.co/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Phoenix Wallet</strong></a> while sunsetting the former one.</p><p>Phoenix is a non-custodial mobile native LN wallet for both iOS and Android users. It will handle the opening and closing of channels for you and the wallet itself is a full-fledged Lightning node. A minimum of 10,000 sats is needed to open the channel and “activate” the account.</p><p>The wallet allows for on-the-fly channel creation but there’s a fee involved. This function is recommended to be disabled on the app as it may result in the unnecessary creation of multiple channels when receiving payment amounts that exceed the channel’s balance limit. When this function is disabled, unsuccessful payments will simply fail, thus never leaving the sender’s wallet.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Image_via_Phoenix_Wallet_aa275863e5.png"" alt=""Phoenix Wallet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Image_via_Phoenix_Wallet_aa275863e5.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Image_via_Phoenix_Wallet_aa275863e5.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Image_via_Phoenix_Wallet_aa275863e5.png 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Image via Phoenix Wallet</i></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Zeus Wallet</strong></h3><p>Rather than a straight-up wallet, the <a href=""https://zeusln.app/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Zeus Wallet</strong></a> app is more of a mobile version of a Lightning node management app that allows for Lightning payments to be made on it. This app does not have its own node and requires the user to connect to an existing node. This alone makes it out of reach for beginners. However, for those who are interested to run their own node, this would be a good app to consider.</p><p>The app is open-sourced and non-custodial, and supports both Lightning and the Bitcoin network itself, with a strong privacy focus through Tor connection and the ability to hide the sending data in Privacy mode.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/Zeus_Wallet_1024x498_a869335c87.png"" alt=""Zeus Wallet"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_Zeus_Wallet_1024x498_a869335c87.png 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_Zeus_Wallet_1024x498_a869335c87.png 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_Zeus_Wallet_1024x498_a869335c87.png 750w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/large_Zeus_Wallet_1024x498_a869335c87.png 1000w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>Secure transactions with Zeus wallet.

Central to the white paper is the Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC), used for payment routing over multiple channels, that gave Lightning Network a meaty feature.</p><p>In August 2015, ACINQ debuted its new implementation of the Lightning Network known as Eclair. Not long after, they unveiled the Android version of their Lightning wallet by the same name. This was quickly followed by <a href=""https://lightning.engineering/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Lightning Labs</strong></a> and <a href=""https://blockstream.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Blockstream</strong></a>. The three companies were the main actors pushing the development of the Lightning protocol.</p><p>From the first purchase of a physical item in January 2018 to today, where there are companies like Bitrefill and Fold App to name a few that offer BTC purchases for daily necessities, adoption is slow but surely growing by the day.

I then decided to go on the hunt for a good Lightning wallet to use and share my findings with you. It’s clear to me that mobile apps are the way to go for maximum convenience.</p><p>Depending on how adventurous I am (or you are), I may consider running my own Lightning node in the future. For now though, I’m happy to use a custodial wallet as the quickest and easiest way to dip my toes in. While there is a risk of funds’ safety with a custodial wallet, it’s worth pausing a moment to consider: if I only keep 10,000 sats in that wallet, and it’s all gone, that’s a small price to pay, whereas I may benefit greatly from the upside.</p><p>Once you start seeing Bitcoin as a denomination of sorts, it could be a gradual shift to viewing the value of items in sats instead of dollars.

Naturally, every cryptocurrency exchange has pros and cons, as the following information shows regarding Coinbase: –</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>User-friendly for beginners:</strong> Coinbase’s website and mobile app are easy to navigate and allow for quick buying, selling, and exchanging of cryptocurrencies.</li><li><strong>Large selection of cryptocurrencies:</strong> Coinbase offers over 240 cryptocurrencies, with new cryptos added regularly.</li><li><strong>Earning opportunities:</strong> Users can earn interest on eligible balances and participate in Coinbase Learning Rewards by completing crypto education courses.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High transaction fees:</strong> Coinbase’s main platform transaction fees are often expensive.</li><li><strong>Customer service issues:</strong> Coinbase has received negative feedback regarding their customer service, especially regarding security issues.</li><li><strong>Coinbase controls private keys:</strong> On the primary platform, Coinbase holds and controls users’ private keys, which represent ownership of their cryptocurrency. Only with the Coinbase Wallet can users have responsibility for their private keys.</li></ul><p>The cons of Coinbase, to be fair, are comparable with most cryptocurrency exchanges. If you’re <a href=""https://www.coinbureau.com/education/cryptocurrency-beginners-guide/""><strong>new to the cryptocurrency</strong></a> market, you may wonder if using Coinbase for your cryptocurrencies is safe.</p><h2><strong>Is Coinbase Safe to Use for Cryptocurrencies?</strong></h2><p>Coinbase takes user account protection seriously, but you must take essential steps to protect your account. <a href=""https://www.coinbureau.com/review/forta-fort/""><strong>Cybercrime</strong></a> is increasing, and hackers are becoming more adept at applying sophisticated protocols to identify vulnerabilities on exchange platforms.</p><p>You’ve worked hard to build your cryptocurrency assets, so take responsibility for their security.</p><h3><strong>Should You Keep Your Cryptocurrency on Coinbase?</strong></h3><p>It’s important to note that while Coinbase and other cryptocurrency platforms implement security measures, by the nature of a cryptocurrency exchange, they are all centralised entities. Therefore, the risk of a hack or cybercrime exists.</p><p>Let’s explore how to get started if you intend to store your cryptocurrency on Coinbase.</p><h2><strong>How to Store Your Cryptocurrency Safely on Coinbase</strong></h2><p>To protect your crypto assets, we advise best practices on Coinbase and other crypto exchanges, such as enabling two-factor authentication and a super strong password.</p><p>Only have your crypto assets live on Coinbase when you are actively trading. Once your session completes, transfer your cryptocurrencies to your self-custody wallet.</p><h3><strong>Security Features of Coinbase</strong></h3><p>Coinbase has implemented several robust security features to protect its users’ accounts and funds.</p><p><strong>Some of the key security features on Coinbase include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Two-factor authentication:</strong> Coinbase users enable two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires a second verification step, such as a text message or an authentication app, before they can access their account.</li><li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Coinbase enables user biometric authentication on its mobile app, such as fingerprint or face recognition.</li><li><strong>SSL Encryption: </strong>Coinbase uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to secure all website traffic between the browser and web server. It protects users’ sensitive information by scrambling data, so it isn’t easy for hackers to intercept.</li><li><strong>Offline Storage:</strong> Most users’ funds on Coinbase are held in offline storage, also known as cold storage, to protect against potential hacking attacks.</li><li><strong>Insurance Protection</strong>: Coinbase has insurance protection for all eligible cryptocurrency holdings, including digital currency in the Coinbase Vault (<i>see below</i>), to protect against theft and hacking.</li><li><strong>Account Activity Monitoring:</strong> Coinbase monitors account activity for suspicious behaviour and alerts users if any unusual activity is detected.</li><li><strong>Whitelisting:</strong> Users can set up a whitelist of approved addresses to ensure that withdrawals get sent to trusted addresses.</li></ul><p>As you can see, Coinbase has an excellent range of security features, and we would advise using as many of them as possible. Coinbase Vault is a popular cold storage feature to protect your digital assets, which we will cover below.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/coinbasewallet_768x416_d41697d16f.jpg"" alt=""coinbasewallet-768x416.jpg"" srcset=""https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/thumbnail_coinbasewallet_768x416_d41697d16f.jpg 245w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/small_coinbasewallet_768x416_d41697d16f.jpg 500w,https://image.coinbureau.dev/strapi/medium_coinbasewallet_768x416_d41697d16f.jpg 750w,"" sizes=""100vw""><figcaption><i>The Coinbase Wallet has Many Security Features (Image source: Coinbase)</i></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Coinbase Vault</strong></h3><p>Coinbase Vault is a helpful feature offered by Coinbase for users to store their cryptocurrency, such as <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>Bitcoin (BTC</strong></a>) in a secure offline location called cold storage (offline storage).

Otherwise, your numbers will be inaccurate. Occasionally, crypto tax software may incorrectly label non-taxable vs taxable transactions, which can be tricky to address.</li><li><strong>Potential unsupported chains:</strong> With the exponential speed of blockchain development, some chains might not be supported by the crypto tax software. You can solve this problem by manually completing transaction details and uploading them with a CSV file.</li><li><strong>Missing calculations from previous years:</strong> Suppose you have traded or invested in crypto for multiple years and only just realised you must file a tax return. This situation is challenging because you need records of every transaction since you began. Yes, leaving your tax filing too long can be a giant headache.</li><li><strong>Unrequested Airdrops to your wallet: </strong>Not all airdrops are legit, and there are plenty of spam coins. The issue with crypto tax software is that it cannot tell if an airdrop is legitimate. Hopefully, you don't have thousands of airdrops to wade through, but be aware of this possibility.</li><li><strong>Shifting legal grey areas:</strong> The multiple potential crypto transactions can present murky legal areas about what constitutes as taxable. Don't wing it. If in any doubt, consult with the crypto software support team or contact an expert in crypto taxes. Accointing helps you classify transactions, but be on the lookout, just in case.</li><li><strong>DeFI &amp; NFTs:</strong> Imagine one DeFi transaction appearing as hundreds.

Both are established and recognised as go-to options for crypto tax filing.<!-- /wp:paragraph -->&nbsp;<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --></p><h3>Accointing vs Koinly<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:heading --></h3><p>Accointing was established in 2018 and already has two awards under its belt for best crypto portfolio design. It is comparable for services, integrations etc., with Koinly, CoinLedger and other crypto tax software providers. Koinly has a specific section for accountants, which Accointing does not.<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p>Koinly's pricing is similar to Accointing. The primary difference is that <a href=""https://{MIGRATED_DOMAIN}/deals/crypto-tax/koinly/"">Koinly </a>offers a free version of up to 10,000 transactions, a newbie (100 transactions), Hodler (1,000 transactions and Trader (10,000+ transactions). So, Accointing's number of transactions is more generous at the Whale level (see below Accointing fees).<!-- wp:heading --><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><h2>Accointing Fees<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:heading --></h2><p>Accointing has a range of packages to suit every level, whether you're an experienced crypto trader or getting started with crypto investing.
